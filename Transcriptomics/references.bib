abstract = {In China, the grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) is a highly significant freshwater fish species. Enhancing growth-related traits can boost output, decrease costs, and accelerate the production of market-ready fish. In this study, the 21 K grass carp array was used to genotype 365 grass carp individuals, identifying 18,161 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 24 chromosomes. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to detect SNPs and genes potentially associated with growth traits, including body height, body depth, body length, and body weight. We identified a strong positive genetic correlation (0.997–0.999) and a moderate to high heritability (0.421–0.501) among the three growth performance traits (body height, body depth, and body weight). Five SNPs, located on four chromosomes (LG01, LG05, LG07, and LG22), were identified as associated with growth-related traits. The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by these SNPs ranged from 6.3 to 13.5% for the growth-related traits. Two of these SNPs were associated with all traits, except body length. Additionally, 98 genes were annotated by the identified SNPs. Most of the candidate genes were known to be involved in muscle growth and bone development. Gene ontology enrichment analysis suggested that terms related to metabolic process and skeletal system morphogenesis were significantly enriched. This study offers insights into the genetic architecture of growth-related traits and provides effective molecular markers for future genome-wide selection breeding of grass carp.},

abstract = {Background: Understanding sex determination (SD) across taxa is a major challenge for evolutionary biology. The new genomic tools are paving the way to identify genomic features underlying SD in fish, a group frequently showing limited sex chromosome differentiation and high SD evolutionary turnover. Turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is a commercially important flatfish with an undifferentiated ZW/ZZ SD system and remarkable sexual dimorphism. Here we describe a new long-read turbot genome assembly used to disentangle the genetic architecture of turbot SD by combining genomics and classical genetics approaches. Results: The new turbot genome assembly consists of 145 contigs (N50 = 22.9 Mb), 27 of them representing >95% of its estimated genome size. A genome wide association study (GWAS) identified a $\sim$ 6.8 Mb region on chromosome 12 associated with sex in 69.4% of the 36 families analyzed. The highest associated markers flanked sox2, the only gene in the region showing differential expression between sexes before gonad differentiation. A single SNP showed consistent differences between Z and W chromosomes. The analysis of a broad sample of families suggested the presence of additional genetic and/or environmental factors on turbot SD. Conclusions: The new chromosome-level turbot genome assembly, one of the most contiguous fish assemblies to date, facilitated the identification of sox2 as a consistent candidate gene putatively driving SD in this species. This chromosome SD system barely showed any signs of differentiation, and other factors beyond the main QTL seem to control SD in a certain proportion of families.},

abstract = {The association of molecular variants with phenotypic variation is a main issue in biology, often tackled with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS are challenging, with increasing, but still limited, use in evolutionary biology. We used redundancy analysis (RDA) as a complimentary ordination approach to single- and multitrait GWAS to explore the molecular basis of pigmentation variation in brown trout (Salmo trutta) belonging to wild populations impacted by hatchery fish. Based on 75,684 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers, RDA, single- and multitrait GWAS allowed the extraction of 337 independent colour patterning loci (CPLs) associated with trout pigmentation traits, such as the number of red and black spots on flanks. Collectively, these CPLs (i) mapped onto 35 out of 40 brown trout linkage groups indicating a polygenic genomic architecture of pigmentation, (ii) were found to be associated with 218 candidate genes, including 197 genes formerly mentioned in the literature associated to skin pigmentation, skin patterning, differentiation or structure notably in a close relative, the rainbow trout (Onchorhynchus mykiss), and (iii) related to functions relevant to pigmentation variation (e.g., calcium- and ion-binding, cell adhesion). Annotated CPLs include genes with well-known pigmentation effects (e.g., PMEL, SLC45A2, SOX10), but also markers associated with genes formerly found expressed in rainbow or brown trout skins. RDA was also shown to be useful to investigate management issues, especially the dynamics of trout pigmentation submitted to several generations of hatchery introgression.},

abstract = {The differentiation and variation of body color in fish is an important component of biological evolution and phylogenetic research, and is influenced by several factors such as heredity, nutrition, physiological hormones and rearing conditions, with heredity being the most critical factor. An improved comprehension of the genetic regulation in different carp populations will facilitate future applications of precision breeding and pigment cell development-related genes editing. In this study, we used restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (2d-RAD) to determine the distribution characteristics of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight common carp strains including six koi strains, i.e., Kohaku (Hb), Taisho (Dz), Showa (Zh), Golden (Hj), Matsukawabake (Sch) and Five-color (Ws), and two genetically improved breeding strains, i.e., FFRC No. 2 strain (Fr) and red FFRC strain (Hfr), and then SNP markers to resolve genetic information on the population structure and skin color formation of these strains. We found that most individuals of eight strains were clearly divided into eight clades. Genetic diversity within Fr, Sch and Ws is relatively high, while it is low within Dz, Hb and Hfr. A comparison between the populations revealed that Hfr and Ws have the highest degree of genetic differences, while Hb and Dz have the lowest. The GWAS analysis for two strategies identified several SNPs that are significantly related to skin color variation and affect melanin synthesis (ephrinb2, slc22a23, herc2, ephb2), carotenoid metabolism (oca2, bcmo1, bco2) and circadian rhythm(cipc). To summarize, our study provides some information on the genetic structure and diversity of Japanese koi and Chinese FFRC carp. Furthermore, based on the data obtained on relevant genes related to skin color differentiation and pigmentation, it can provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent integration of dominant traits and precision breeding in carps.},

abstract = {Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions - both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.},

abstract = {Flatfish have the most extreme asymmetric body morphology of vertebrates. During metamorphosis, one eye migrates to the contralateral side of the skull, and this migration is accompanied by extensive craniofacial transformations and simultaneous development of lopsided body pigmentation. The evolution of this developmental and physiological innovation remains enigmatic. Comparative genomics of two flatfish and transcriptomic analyses during metamorphosis point to a role for thyroid hormone and retinoic acid signaling, as well as phototransduction pathways. We demonstrate that retinoic acid is critical in establishing asymmetric pigmentation and, via cross-talk with thyroid hormones, in modulating eye migration. The unexpected expression of the visual opsins from the phototransduction pathway in the skin translates illumination differences and generates retinoic acid gradients that underlie the generation of asymmetry. Identifying the genetic underpinning of this unique developmental process answers long-standing questions about the evolutionary origin of asymmetry, but it also provides insight into the mechanisms that control body shape in vertebrates.},

The results showed a large variation of VNN resistance between the four populations tested as well as between sire families within strain. The survivals between pure wild populations SEM, NEM, WEM and NAT were estimated at 99%, 94%, 62%, and 44%, respectively. A moderate intra-population heritability of VNN resistance, calculated based on liability scale with sire model, was recorded for the first time in European sea bass (h2u = 0.26 ± 0.11). Finally, moderate negative genetic correlations between VNN resistance and daily growth coefficient (DGC) and body weight (BW) were also demonstrated (− 0.28 ± 0.20, − 0.35 ± 0.14, respectively) while the genetic correlation between resistance to VNN and fillet adiposity (FA) was weakly negative and not significant (− 0.13 ± 0.19). These results give good prospects of selective breeding of European sea bass for improved resistance to VNN disease.},

abstract = {The leopard coral grouper (Plectropomus leopardus) is a coral reef fish species that exhibits rapid and diverse color variation. However, the presence of melanoma and the high proportion of individuals displaying black color in artificial breeding have led to reduced economic and ornamental value. To pinpoint single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and potential genes linked to the black pigmentation characteristic in this particular species, This study gathered a cohort of 360 specimens from diverse origins and conducted a comprehensive genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) employing whole-genome resequencing. As a result, 57 SNPs related to the black skin trait were identified, and a grand total of 158 genes were annotated within 50 kb of these SNPs. Subsequently, GWAS was applied to three populations (LED, QHH, and QHL), and the corresponding results were compared with the analysis results of the total population. The results of the four GWAS models showed significant enrichment in Rap1 signaling pathway, melanin biosynthesis, metabolic pathways, tyrosine metabolism, cAMP signaling pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, HIF-1 signaling pathway, Ras signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, etc. (p < 0.05), which were mainly associated with eleven genes (POL4, MET, E2F2, COMT, ZBED1, TYRP2, FOXP2, THIKA, LORF2, MYH16 and SOX2). Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in the expression of all 11 genes in the dorsal skin tissue, in 10 genes except COMT in the ventral skin tissue, and in all 11 genes in the caudal fin tissue. These findings imply that the control of body color in the P. leopardus is the result of the joint action of multiple genes and signaling pathways. These findings will contribute to a more profound comprehension of the genetic attributes that underlie the development of black skin in the vibrant P. leopardus, thus furnishing a theoretical foundation for genetic enhancement.},

abstract = {Preventing genetic disorders is essential to improving productivity and animal welfare in aquaculture. We investigated ambicoloration with abnormal eye location (AEL), a unique morphological deformity frequently observed in farmed Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, often in specific broodstock groups, suggesting a genetic basis. To identify the causative region, we conducted genome-wide association studies using MIG-seq as well as pool-seq techniques. Both methods revealed a strong association of the AEL phenotype with a region on chromosome 3 spanning 11–12 Mb. Within this region, five candidate genes with high-impact variants were identified, including pex5la, which is associated with skeletal abnormalities in humans. Since chromosome 3 serves as the sex chromosome in Japanese flounder and the sex-determining gene (amh) is located at ∼16.5 Mb, we also identified the genetic sex of the studied specimens. All AEL individuals were genetically female (XX), supporting the hypothesis that AEL follows an X-linked recessive mode of inheritance. Surprisingly, no broad linkage disequilibrium (LD) block was detected between the AEL-specific region (∼11–12 Mb) and the sex-determining gene amh (∼16.5 Mb), despite the complete association of genetic sex with phenotype. However, LD analysis using highly associated SNPs revealed a conserved haplotype block, likely derived from an ancestral segment that includes both the AEL-specific region and amh. Parentage analysis indicated that a limited number of broodstock carrying the deleterious allele contributed disproportionately to spawning, leading to a high incidence of the deformity. These findings suggest that SNP-based genetic screening of broodstock could effectively reduce the occurrence of AEL. This study represents the first report of an X-linked recessive deformity in cultured fish, offering new insight into the genetic management of morphological traits in hatchery populations.},

KEGG pathway analysis using these 35 candidate genes showed that natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, Ras signaling, MAPK signaling, and other pathways were significantly enriched (p < 0.05). Subsequently, GWAS was used for populations of LED, QHH, and QHL respectively, which showed that 7 genes (MIC13, SPIN1, PRS57, FLOT1, TARS, DHI1L, and FGF10) of the above 35 genes were shared in QHH populations. These results will greatly improve the P. leopardus industry by helping understand the molecular mechanisms underlying red-skin color traits. Furthermore, the identified SNPs can be used as markers to aid targeted breeding for skin color in P. leopardus.},

abstract = {In flatfish, body coloration asymmetry and malpigmentation are major issues faced by many aquaculture practitioners. However, the molecular mechanism underlying malpigmentation in flatfish is still unclear. In this study, we used de novo transcriptome sequencing and assembly to construct the skin transcriptome of the Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus; we collected skin samples from the ocular side of normal fish and pigmented skin and non-pigmented skin from the blind side of hypermelanotic fish. Twenty-two SNP loci at the coding regions of 12 genes were identified as candidate SNPs in six pigment synthesis-related KEGG pathways, and two SNPs located on the cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor (ATF)-4-like gene, named ATF-3004-G/A and ATF-3155-C/T, may be associated with hypermelanosis in the blind side. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SNPs associated with malpigmentation has been identified in flatfish. The predominant genotypes of normal flounder at the ATF-3004-G/A locus were GG homozygous (accounting for 64.71%), whereas the predominant genotypes of hypermelanotic flounder were GA heterozygous (accounting for 46%), followed by GG (38%) and AA (16%). At the ATF-3155-C/T locus, CC homozygotes accounted for 92.16% in the normal flounders, whereas the predominant genotypes of hypermelanotic flounder were GA heterozygous (accounting for 52.94%), followed by GG (45.10%) and AA (1.96%). The two SNPs may be used to screen and eliminate the abnormal parents for breeding fine varieties of P. olivaceus. The two SNPS are associated with hypermelanosis and located in ATF4, which is involved in both thyroid hormone synthesis and pigment synthesis-related pathways. The expression of ATF4 was higher in the skin on the blind side of hypermelanotic P. olivaceus, whatever the skin was pigmented or non-pigmented. The relative expression of ATF4 mRNA on the ocular side skin was significantly different from that on the blind side of normal P. olivaceus as well as that of hypermelanotic P. olivaceus, whereas no significant differences were detected between the blind sides pigment skin and non-pigment skin of hypermelanotic P. olivaceus.},

abstract = {The objectives of this research were to assess the genetic diversity, population structure, linkage disequilibrium and perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to search for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that associate with the resistance of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) to White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV). The line here analyzed was formerly founded with animals originated from different origins (Ecuador, Panama, and United States of America), with a history of resistance to WSSV and they have undergone a selection process, currently reaching up to F6 generation. In a controlled challenge to WSSV, this line showed a binary survival (39.0% ± 1.1%) and time to death (109.7 ± 0.9 h post-infection) (n = 1944). The population was genotyped using a commercially available 50 K SNP chip and ∼32 K SNPs remained after quality control of genotypes. Population structure, extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD), and genetic variability in the population were evaluated. The principal component analysis (PCA) did not show apparent genetic stratification in the population. The LD decay estimated, revealed a rapid decrease in r2 as the physical distance between markers increased. The most significant decrease was observed in the first 30Kb of distance, suggesting the need to use a higher density of informative markers to meet the requirement of a genome-wide association study in L. vannamei. The observed and expected heterozygosities were both = 0.38, which indicates that the population presents acceptable genetic variability for WSSV resistance. Two SNPs were significantly associated to WSSV resistance at a genome-wide level, which in turn together explained 0.17% of the genetic variance for the trait. One identified SNP surpassing the genome-wide significance threshold (chromosome 1 at 51207389 bp) is located near potential candidate genes, such as Arylsulfatase B-like (ARSB), and D-beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase mitochondrial-like ($\beta$hyD); which was linked to the humoral immune response to WSSV, in addition to the Putative mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 26 (PMed26); which are associated with the hepatopancreas immune response against infection of WSSV and acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). Our results indicate a polygenic architecture for WSSV resistance in L. vannamei, suggesting that incorporating genome-wide SNP information, through genomic selection, might be the most appropriate approach to accelerate the genetic progress for this trait.},

abstract = {Genomic selection can accelerate genetic progress in aquaculture breeding programmes, particularly for traits measured on siblings of selection candidates. However, it is not widely implemented in most aquaculture species, and remains expensive due to high genotyping costs. Genotype imputation is a promising strategy that can reduce genotyping costs and facilitate the broader uptake of genomic selection in aquaculture breeding programmes. Genotype imputation can predict ungenotyped SNPs in populations genotyped at a low-density (LD), using a reference population genotyped at a high-density (HD). In this study, we used datasets of four aquaculture species (Atlantic salmon, turbot, common carp and Pacific oyster), phenotyped for different traits, to investigate the efficacy of genotype imputation for cost-effective genomic selection. The four datasets had been genotyped at HD, and eight LD panels (300–6,000 SNPs) were generated in silico. SNPs were selected to be: i) evenly distributed according to physical position ii) selected to minimise the linkage disequilibrium between adjacent SNPs or iii) randomly selected. Imputation was performed with three different software packages (AlphaImpute2, FImpute v.3 and findhap v.4). The results revealed that FImpute v.3 was faster and achieved higher imputation accuracies. Imputation accuracy increased with increasing panel density for both SNP selection methods, reaching correlations greater than 0.95 in the three fish species and 0.80 in Pacific oyster. In terms of genomic prediction accuracy, the LD and the imputed panels performed similarly, reaching values very close to the HD panels, except in the pacific oyster dataset, where the LD panel performed better than the imputed panel. In the fish species, when LD panels were used for genomic prediction without imputation, selection of markers based on either physical or genetic distance (instead of randomly) resulted in a high prediction accuracy, whereas imputation achieved near maximal prediction accuracy independently of the LD panel, showing higher reliability. Our results suggests that, in fish species, well-selected LD panels may achieve near maximal genomic selection prediction accuracy, and that the addition of imputation will result in maximal accuracy independently of the LD panel. These strategies represent effective and affordable methods to incorporate genomic selection into most aquaculture settings.},

abstract = {Background: Genotype imputation can help reduce genotyping costs particularly for implementation of genomic selection. In applications entailing large populations, recovering the genotypes of untyped loci using information from reference individuals that were genotyped with a higher density panel is computationally challenging. Popular imputation methods are based upon the Hidden Markov model and have computational constraints due to an intensive sampling process. A fast, deterministic approach, which makes use of both family and population information, is presented here. All individuals are related and, therefore, share haplotypes which may differ in length and frequency based on their relationships. The method starts with family imputation if pedigree information is available, and then exploits close relationships by searching for long haplotype matches in the reference group using overlapping sliding windows. The search continues as the window size is shrunk in each chromosome sweep in order to capture more distant relationships.Results: The proposed method gave higher or similar imputation accuracy than Beagle and Impute2 in cattle data sets when all available information was used. When close relatives of target individuals were present in the reference group, the method resulted in higher accuracy compared to the other two methods even when the pedigree was not used. Rare variants were also imputed with higher accuracy. Finally, computing requirements were considerably lower than those of Beagle and Impute2. The presented method took 28 minutes to impute from 6 k to 50 k genotypes for 2,000 individuals with a reference size of 64,429 individuals.Conclusions: The proposed method efficiently makes use of information from close and distant relatives for accurate genotype imputation. In addition to its high imputation accuracy, the method is fast, owing to its deterministic nature and, therefore, it can easily be used in large data sets where the use of other methods is impractical. {\textcopyright} 2014 Sargolzaei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {For most human complex diseases and traits, SNPs identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) explain only a small fraction of the heritability. Here we report a user-friendly software tool called genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA), which was developed based on a method we recently developed to address the "missing heritability" problem. GCTA estimates the variance explained by all the SNPs on a chromosome or on the whole genome for a complex trait rather than testing the association of any particular SNP to the trait. We introduce GCTA's five main functions: data management, estimation of the genetic relationships from SNPs, mixed linear model analysis of variance explained by the SNPs, estimation of the linkage disequilibrium structure, and GWAS simulation. We focus on the function of estimating the variance explained by all the SNPs on the X chromosome and testing the hypotheses of dosage compensation. The GCTA software is a versatile tool to estimate and partition complex trait variation with large GWAS data sets. {\textcopyright} 2011 The American Society of Human Genetics.},

However, the high albino rate of the breeding population has caused a significant loss to the aquaculture industry. To study the molecular mechanism of albinism, the present study used an albino Chinese tongue sole family to construct three simple sequence repeat (SSR) linkage groups, and draft a preliminary linkage map related to albinism. After albinism-related loci mapping, 18 albinism-related loci were detected under two models (containing 2407 genes) compared to the Chinese tongue sole genome. One of these loci, the tyrosinase related protein (tyrp2), which has been reported previously as an important gene regulating both eumelanin and phaeomelanin levels, was indicated to be the possible cause of albinism. Thirty-five Gene Ontology (GO) terms and 14 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome pathways were annotated via bioinformatic analyses. One GO term with protein tyrosine kinase activity, which contained 10 genes, was previously suggested to affect fish albinism. These results establish a foundation for further in-depth study of albinism in Chinese tongue sole.},

A breeding program to improve economically important growth traits in grass carp would benefit from effective molecular markers. Although a genetic linkage map of grass carp has been constructed, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and a genome-wide association study (GWAS) have been conducted, the effective number of SNP markers and genes currently available for breeding is still very limited. In this study, we conducted a GWAS based on re-sequencing of individuals to identify genomic regions and candidate genes potentially associated with various growth traits of grass carp, including body weight (BW), body length (BL) and body height (BH). A total of 4,854,366 high-quality SNPs were identified and located on 24 chromosomes. Among them, 31 SNPs were identified as being associated with growth traits, including 8 SNPs on chromosomes 1, 2, 10, 13, 14, 17 and 22 associated with BW, 21 SNPs on chromosomes 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 13, 14, 15, 17, 23 and 24 correlated with BL, and 18 SNPs on chromosomes 2, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17, 23 and 24 related to BH. In addition, 13 of these SNPs were simultaneously associated with two or three growth traits. Within a 48 kb range upstream and downstream of these significant SNPs, 120 candidate genes were identified to be associated with the QTLs. Most of these genes were related to growth and development, fat metabolism, bone mineralization and differentiation, vascular development, and feeding regulation. Notably, the genes pwp1, cers5, chrebp, lsr, ctnnbip1, smoc2, ano6 and cckrb were specifically associated with growth, fat, bone formation and feeding. Our findings would provide a foundation for molecular marker-assisted selection, genomic selection, and functional analysis of growth traits in grass carp.},

abstract = {Albinos of Japanese flounder were found in a hatchery population. Their body color was not uniform and a large variation was observed. To examine genetic effects on the albinism and the color variation, this study estimated relatedness among albinos and wild-type individuals and heritability of body color among albinos using marker-based approaches. Significant differences between albinos and wild-type individuals were observed in all color components of red, green, blue, hue, saturation and intensity with large variations within each group. The number of alleles per locus at seven microsatellite loci was significantly lower in the albinos than in the wild-type individuals. The dendrogram of relatedness estimated from microsatellites indicated that most albinos tended to be closely related to each other. The genetic data suggested that the albinos were produced by some, but not one or many, pairs. Marker-based estimates of heritability among all individuals were significantly greater than zero for all color components with estimates of 0.77-0.98. In addition, significantly positive heritability was observed for red, green and intensity in the albinos. These results indicated that the albinism detected in a hatchery population of Japanese flounder might be strongly heritable as observed in other fish species. Furthermore, estimates of heritability suggested that the color variation observed among the albinos was partly caused by additive genetic effects. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Genetic improvement programs have been developed for many aquaculture species for a variety of economically important traits, and selective breeding has been proposed for low to moderate heritability disease traits to increase disease resistance. The aim of this study was to perform a genome wide association (GWA) analysis to identify the genomic architecture of BKD resistance and detect SNP markers associated with BKD resistance in a commercial population of Atlantic salmon held in seawater. We experimentally challenged 652 post smolts from 63 families with R. salmoninarum through intraperitoneal injection. A binary trait, overall challenge survival, and a quantitative trait, day of death, were recorded for each challenged individual. DNA extraction and 50 K SNP genotyping was performed for 576 individuals. Fish and loci that did not pass quality control and fish with >10% European ancestry were removed leaving 507 post smolts genotyped for 44,527 SNPs. GWA for survival and time to death was conducted using a mixed model approach using the relationship matrix to account for population and family structure and a Cox proportional hazards model, respectively. A single marker on Ssa08 was significantly associated with survival at the chromosome wide level. One marker located on Ssa04 was significantly associated with time to death at the chromosome wide level. The two significant SNPs explained a small percentage of the phenotypic variance and were located on different chromosomes, 4.0% (Ssa08) and 5.3% (Ssa04), indicating a polygenic trait.},

abstract = {Imputed whole-genome sequence (WGS) has been proposed to improve genome-wide association studies (GWAS), since all causative mutations responsible for phenotypic variation are expected to be present in the data. This approach was applied on a large number of purebred (PB) and crossbred (CB) pigs for 18 pork color traits to evaluate the impact of using imputed WGS relative to medium-density marker panels. The traits included Minolta A*, B*, and L* for fat (FCOL), quadriceps femoris muscle (QFCOL), thawed loin muscle (TMCOL), fresh ham gluteus medius (GMCOL), ham iliopsoas muscle (ICOL), and longissimus dorsi muscle on the fresh loin (FMCOL). Sequence variants were imputed from a medium-density marker panel (61K for CBs and 50K for PBs) in all genotyped pigs using BeagleV5.0. We obtained high imputation accuracy (average of 0.97 for PBs and 0.91 for CBs). GWAS were conducted for three datasets: 954 CBs and 891 PBs, and the combined CBs and PBs. For most traits, no significant associations were detected, regardless of panel density or population type. However, quantitative trait loci (QTL) regions were only found for a few traits including TMCOL Minolta A* and GMCOL Minolta B* (CBs), FMCOL Minolta B*, FMCOL Minolta L*, and ICOL Minolta B* (PBs) and FMCOL Minolta A*, FMCOL Minolta B*, GMCOL Minolta B*, and ICOL Minolta B* (Combined dataset). More QTL regions were identified with WGS (n = 58) relative to medium-density marker panels (n = 22). Most of the QTL were linked to previously reported QTLs or candidate genes that have been previously reported to be associated with meat quality, pH and pork color; e.g., VIL1, PRKAG3, TTLL4, and SLC11A1, USP37. CTDSP1 gene on SSC15 has not been previously associated with meat color traits in pigs. The findings suggest any added value of WGS was only for detecting novel QTL regions when the sample size is sufficiently large as with the Combined dataset in this study. The percentage of phenotypic variance explained by the most significant SNPs also increased with WGS compared with medium-density panels. The results provide additional insights into identification of a number of candidate regions and genes for pork color traits in different pig populations.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The American Society of Human Genetics.

abstract = {A pleuronectiform fish, the barfin flounder, Verasper moseri, is promising for aquaculture and resource enhancement in Northern Japan due to its high commercial value. Hypermelanosis of its non-eyed side, which frequently occurs under culture conditions, diminishes its commercial value. Two peptide hormones, melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), having opposing actions, are associated with the color changes of fish. We have previously reported the positive effect of MCH in preventing hypermelanosis. Here, we examined the effects of MSH on the occurrence of hypermelanosis. A single injection of Des-Ac-$\alpha$-MSH [0.01 nmol/g-10 nmol/g (0.016 $\mu$g-16 $\mu$g/g)] did not change the eyed-side body color, while a single injection of MCH [0.1 nmol/g (0.21 $\mu$g/g)] made the eyed-side color paler. No difference was observed in eyed-side lightness between fish injected with MCH (0.1 nmol/g) and those receiving MCH (0.1 nmol/g) and an increased amount of Des-Ac-$\alpha$-MSH (0.01 nmol/g-10 nmol/g) simultaneously. These results indicate that MSH does not suppress the in vivo body color-paling effects of MCH in barfin flounders. On the other hand, implantation of a cholesterol pellet containing Des-Ac-$\alpha$-MSH (280 $\mu$g, twice at 29-day interval) increased hypermelanosis of the non-eyed side of barfin flounders compared to control fish. Eyed-side bodies of MSH-treated fish were darker than control fish; thus, MSH is involved in morphological color change including ectopic melanin synthesis in non-eyed-side skin. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Body color is one of the most noticeable phenotypic and economic characteristics in fish. Fish exhibit a diverse array of body color mutations influenced by factors such as artificial selection and natural mutations. Elucidating the genetic mechanisms of these color variants in fish is crucial for developing new breeds with higher ornamental value. In this study, we identified a nonsense mutation in csf1ra (c. 1249 C>T) with whole genome resequencing technology, and which may potentially contribute to the albino phenotype in Channa asiatica. The albino individuals exhibited a substantial decrease in the expression level of csf1ra compared to that of the wild individuals. To unravel the underlying mechanism of csf1ra, we delved into comparative transcriptomic and gene expression analyses. Our findings suggest that csf1ra may impact tyrosine kinase activity. Furthermore, csf1ra may not only regulate the expression levels of genes (sox9, ephb6, and wnt9) involved in melanin-based pigmentation but also influence genes (ampd3, ak1, and bco1) associated with non-melanin-based pigmentation. Our study investigated the genetic basis of the albino mutant of C. asiatica and provided new insights into the function of csf1ra in fish pigmentation.},

abstract = {Paralichthys olivaceus is the kind of cold-water benthic marine fish. In the early stages of development, the symmetrical juveniles transform into an asymmetrical body shape through metamorphosis for adapting benthic life. After that, one side of the fish body is attached to the ground, and the eyes turn to the opposite side which is called ocular side. The body color also appears asymmetry. The skin on the ocular side is dark brown, and the skin on the blind side is white without pigmentation. Pseudo-albinism and hypermelanosis have been considered distinct body color disorders in flatfish. Pseudo-albinism and hypermelanosis in Paralichthys olivaceus are due to abnormal or uneven pigment distribution, due to the interaction of hereditary and environmental factors, rather than a single-nucleotide mutation of a specific gene. Here, we report three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) responsible for both pseudo-albinism and hypermelanosis, which are located on two body color-related genes involved in melanogenesis-related pathways. c.2440C>A (P. V605I) and c.2271-96T>C are located on the Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 2-like (ITPR2) (Gene ID: 109624047), they are located in exon 16 and the non-coding region, respectively, and c.2406C>A (P.H798N) is located in exon 13 of the adenylate cyclase type 6-like (AC6) gene(Gene ID: 109630770). ITPR2 and AC6 expression, which both participate in the thyroid hormone synthesis pathway associated with pseudo-albinism and hypermelanosis in P. olivaceus, were also investigated using qRT-PCR. In hypermelanotic fish, there were relatively higher levels of expression in ITPR2 and AC6 mRNA of hyper-pigmented skin of blind side than that of non-pigmented skin on the blind side and pigmented skin on the ocular side, while in pseudo-albino fish, expression level of ITPR2 and AC6 mRNA in pigmented skin of ocular side was significantly higher than that in non-pigmented skin both ocular and blind side. The results indicated that the expression of the two genes in abnormal parts of body color is positively correlated with pigmentation, suggesting that the influence of abnormal expression of two genes on the pigmentation in abnormal parts of body color deserves further study.},

Generally, the eyeless side of the Chinese tongue sole is white and the side with eyes is brown after metamorphosis, hypermelanosis may still occur in the eyeless side in certain individuals after metamorphosis, which greatly decreases consumer acceptance and market price. In order to study the possibility of genetic improvement, we determined genomic markers in Chinese tongue sole using the genotyping-by-sequencing method and analyzed their association with hypermelanosis area. Genetic analysis showed that hypermelanosis was a complicated quantitative trait, and the estimated heritability for hypermelanosis incidence and area ratio were 0.16 and 0.21, respectively. Genomic selection analysis showed that selection based on hypermelanosis incidence and area ratio had similar reliabilities and prediction accuracies, indicating the feasibility of genetic improvement. Nine loci were significantly associated with hypermelanosis, few of which included genes or flanked genes potentially associated with skin disease, indicating the potential complicated genetic mechanisms underlying hypermelanosis in the Chinese tongue sole.},

abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS - the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases - make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas. {\textcopyright} 2010 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.},

abstract = {Sea louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis) infestation of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is a significant challenge in aquaculture. Over the years, this parasite has developed immunity to medicinal control compounds, and non-medicinal control methods have been proven to be stressful, hence the need to study the genomic architecture of salmon resistance to sea lice. Thus, this research used whole-genome sequence (WGS) data to study the genetic basis of the trait since most research using fewer SNPs did not identify significant quantitative trait loci. Mowi Genetics AS provided the genotype (50 k SNPs) and phenotype data for this research after conducting a sea lice challenge test on 3,185 salmon smolts belonging to 191 full-sib families. The 50 k SNP genotype was imputed to WGS using the information from 197 closely related individuals with sequence data. The WGS and 50 k SNPs of the challenged population were then used to estimate genetic parameters, perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS), predict genomic breeding values, and estimate its accuracy for host resistance to sea lice. The heritability of host resistance to sea lice was estimated to be 0.21 and 0.22, while the accuracy of genomic prediction was estimated to be 0.65 and 0.64 for array and WGS data, respectively. In addition, the association test using both array and WGS data did not identify any marker associated with sea lice resistance at the genome-wide level. We conclude that sea lice resistance is a polygenic trait that is moderately heritable. The genomic predictions using medium-density SNP genotyping array were equally good or better than those based on WGS data.},

abstract = {Skin color is an important trait for aquaculture species, serving as an important visual quality criterion determining the market value. Individuals with abnormal red skin color were found in the aquaculture population of Yellow River carp, which is a remarkable strain of common carp in China. To investigate the genetic basis underlying the abnormal skin color and identify the causal gene(s), genome-wide association analysis was conducted by utilizing a previously designed common carp 250 K SNP array for genotyping. A total of 18 significant SNPs were identified, all of which were located on Chr.11. Combined with Fst scanning, a significantly associated genomic region was identified, spanning approximate 5.3 Mb, from 5,708,740 bp to 11,047,520 bp. Five pigmentation-related candidate genes were found, including mitf, oca2, ap1m1, apoeb and lrp8. Quantitative analysis of gene expression of the five genes showed that oca2 was the only gene significantly down-regulated in the skin of red Yellow River carp comparing to that of wildtype individuals. Further disruption of oca2 by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system generated abnormal red individuals, and the DNA sequencing exhibited perturbation of peaks in the sgRNA targeted region, confirming the key function of oca2 gene in coloration of Yellow River carp. Our study revealed that oca2 gene was the causal gene responsible for the abnormal red skin color of Yellow River carp. Our findings would not only unravel the genetic basis of abnormal skin color in common carp, but also advance our knowledge of skin color genetics in teleost, and would speed up the molecular selection of fish species with consumer's favorite skin color.},

These genes are primarily involved in processes such as immune regulation, food uptake, energy metabolism, and signal regulation. Exploring potential genes and regions related to the growth of black carp through resequencing association analysis offers theoretical insights for genetic research and molecular marker-assisted breeding in black carp. It also supports sustainable aquaculture practices, which are crucial for the conservation and utilization of fishery resources.},

abstract = {Background: Flavobacterium columnare is the pathogen agent of columnaris disease, a major emerging disease that affects rainbow trout aquaculture. Selective breeding using genomic selection has potential to achieve cumulative improvement of the host resistance. However, genomic selection is expensive partly because of the cost of genotyping large numbers of animals using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The objective of this study was to assess the efficiency of genomic selection for resistance to F. columnare using in silico low-density (LD) panels combined with imputation. After a natural outbreak of columnaris disease, 2874 challenged fish and 469 fish from the parental generation (n = 81 parents) were genotyped with 27,907 SNPs. The efficiency of genomic prediction using LD panels was assessed for 10 panels of different densities, which were created in silico using two sampling methods, random and equally spaced. All LD panels were also imputed to the full 28K HD panel using the parental generation as the reference population, and genomic predictions were re-evaluated. The potential of prioritizing SNPs that are associated with resistance to F. columnare was also tested for the six lower-density panels. Results: The accuracies of both imputation and genomic predictions were similar with random and equally-spaced sampling of SNPs. Using LD panels of at least 3000 SNPs or lower-density panels (as low as 300 SNPs) combined with imputation resulted in accuracies that were comparable to those of the 28K HD panel and were 11% higher than the pedigree-based predictions. Conclusions: Compared to using the commercial HD panel, LD panels combined with imputation may provide a more affordable approach to genomic prediction of breeding values, which supports a more widespread adoption of genomic selection in aquaculture breeding programmes.},

abstract = {Heat tolerance is an important ability for fish to cope with increased temperature. Large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) is one of the most economically important mariculture fish in China. However, the sustainable development of large yellow croaker aquaculture has long been hampered by extremely high temperature in summer, which is further intensified by the ever-increased global warming. To relieve mass death caused by extreme heat events, it is essential to improve the heat tolerance of this species, which will benefit from a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis underlying heat tolerance. Here, using a 650 K high density SNP array, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on acute heat tolerance (AHT) of large yellow croaker. As a result, 5 significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on 4 chromosomes were identified, indicating the polygenic control characteristics of this trait. A clear peak on Chr19 was found and most of the nearby genes showed differential expression during heat stress, indicating the potential relevance of this region with AHT. Based on the 5 identified SNPs, we predicted 30 candidate genes including heat shock factor protein 1, DnaJ homolog subfamily B member 4, protein Hikeshi, protein disulfide-isomerase A3 etc. Further comparative and validation analysis suggested the importance of blood vessel regulation, heat shock response and endoplasmic reticulum stress response in mediating the interindividual AHT variation of large yellow croaker. These results provide insights into the genetic basis of AHT in fish and will be helpful for heat-tolerance improvement of large yellow croaker by marker-assisted selection.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in genomic technologies have led to the discovery and application of DNA-markers [e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)] for the genetic improvement of several aquaculture species. The identification of specific genomic regions associated with economically important traits, using, for example, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), has allowed the discovery and incorporation of markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) into aquaculture breeding programs through marker-assisted selection (MAS). However, most of the traits of economic relevance are expected to be controlled by many QTLs, each one explaining only a small proportion of the genetic variation. For traits under polygenic control, prediction of the genetic merit of animals based on the sum of effects at positions across the entire genome (i.e. genomic estimated breeding values, GEBV, which are used for what has become known as genomic selection), has been demonstrated to speed the rate of genetic gain for several traits in aquaculture breeding. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the development and application of genomic technologies in uncovering the genetic basis of complex traits and accelerating the genetic progress in aquaculture species, as well as providing future perspectives about the deployment of novel molecular technologies for selective breeding in coming years.},

The vibrant coloration of fish, controlled by complex genetic and environmental interactions, serves critical roles in ecological functions such as mating, predation, and camouflage. This diversity not only makes fish an invaluable model for exploring the molecular mechanisms of pigmentation but also significantly impacts their economic value within the aquaculture industry, where color traits can drive marketability and breeding choices. This review delves into the sophisticated biological processes governing fish pigmentation and discusses their applications in enhancing aquaculture practices. By exploring the intersection of genetic regulation, environmental influences, and advanced breeding techniques, this review highlights both the scientific understanding and practical applications of fish coloration, providing a bridge between basic biological research and its application in commercial aquaculture.},

abstract = {Innovations in Next-Generation Sequencing are enabling generation of DNA sequence data at ever faster rates and at very low cost. For example, the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencer can generate 6 Terabases of data in less than two days, sequencing nearly 20 Billion short DNA fragments called reads at the low cost of $1000 per human genome. Large sequencing centers typically employ hundreds of such systems. Such high-throughput and low-cost generation of data underscores the need for commensurate acceleration in downstream computational analysis of the sequencing data. A fundamental step in downstream analysis is mapping of the reads to a long reference DNA sequence, such as a reference human genome. Sequence mapping is a compute-intensive step that accounts for more than 30% of the overall time of the GATK (Genome Analysis ToolKit) best practices workflow. BWA-MEM is one of the most widely used tools for sequence mapping and has tens of thousands of users. In this work, we focus on accelerating BWA-MEM through an efficient architecture aware implementation, while maintaining identical output. The volume of data requires distributed computing and is usually processed on clusters or cloud deployments with multicore processors usually being the platform of choice. Since the application can be easily parallelized across multiple sockets (even across distributed memory systems) by simply distributing the reads equally, we focus on performance improvements on a single socket multicore processor. BWA-MEM run time is dominated by three kernels, collectively responsible for more than 85% of the overall compute time. We improved the performance of the three kernels by 1) using techniques to improve cache reuse, 2) simplifying the algorithms, 3) replacing many small memory allocations with a few large contiguous ones to improve hardware prefetching of data, 4) software prefetching of data, and 5) utilization of SIMD wherever applicable and massive reorganization of the source code to enable these improvements. As a result, we achieved nearly 2×, 183×, and 8× speedups on the three kernels, respectively, resulting in up to 3.5× and 2.4× speedups on end-to-end compute time over the original BWA-MEM on single thread and single socket of Intel Xeon Skylake processor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest reported speedup over BWA-MEM (running on a single CPU) while using a single CPU or a single CPU-single GPGPU/FPGA combination.},

abstract = {The yellow drum (Nibea albiflora) is a kind of marine fish in China and East-Asia. The swim bladder is an important economic trait, which has medicinal and edible value. However, genetic studies of the yellow drum are relatively lacking. We performed two genome-wide association study (GWAS) methods on 371 samples (183 males and 188 females) to identify the genes associated with the swim bladder weight (SBW) and the swim bladder index (SBI). The assembled genome has been deposited into European Nucleotide Archive (accession no. PRJEB24302). Our sequencing technology is based on second-generation sequencing technology, and the longest piece currently assembled is scaffold level. Therefore, totally ten significantly SNPs, located on scaffold18, scaffold75, scaffold120, scaffold148, scaffold238, scaffold328, scaffold670, scaffold1334 and scaffold6097, were identified, respectively. Combining the biological function of the genes around the GWAS signals, ten candidate genes (wnt5a, sstr5, bcl2l11, lum, s1pr1, sec24b, ppp3ca, akap2, dagl and fgf12) were found to be most related to SBW and SBI. It has been fully recognized that the lung and the swim bladder are homologous based on morphological and embryological evidence. Most of these candidate genes are involved in lung development and lung diseases, suggesting they are possibly related to swim bladder.},

abstract = {Staining-type hypermelanosis, defined as blind-side melanosis occurring after completion of metamorphosis, reduces commercial value in hatchery-produced flatfishes. Detailed characterization was performed on the stained area of juvenile Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus to physiologically understand this phenomenon. From 80 to 120 days after hatching, juveniles were reared in sandy and sandless tanks. By classifying the staining degree into 7 levels, about 2 times higher occurrence of middle-level staining was reconfirmed in sandless tank (about 80 %) than in sandy tank (about 40 %). In the stained area, we found 3 types of chromatophores (melanophore, xanthophore, and iridophore) and ctenoid scales, which would be typically observed on the normal ocular side. Detailed examination on the melanophores revealed further similarity between the stained area and the normal ocular side, in terms of the distribution at 2 layers (shallower and deeper than scale), and the densities in both layers (about 1000 cells/mm2 above scale and 200 cells/mm2 beneath scale). These results strongly suggest that the staining is a status change in the body surface conditions from the blind side to that on the ocular side, and not a simple darkening caused by disordered proliferation of melanophores on the blind side.},

abstract = {Pigmentation is an important factor for the survival of organisms in different environments; in fish, it plays a key role in social communication and shoal formation. Pigmentation mediates communication among colour phenotypes, as fish may temporarily change colouring to indicate their position in a social hierarchy. Although some colour phenotypes may be more common, less frequent colourations do not appear to significantly impact fish welfare, as aggression is directed more towards common, typically pigmented phenotypes than rare phenotypes. The relationship between pigmentation and fish behaviour can be clearly observed with extremely coloured phenotypes, i.e., albino and melanistic individuals. The melanocortin hypothesis states that phenotypes with more pigmentation are more aggressive, reproductively active, and resistant to stress as well as having better overall health. However, the high levels of aggression expressed by melanistic phenotypes may reduce the well-being of less intensely pigmented phenotypes if these individuals are kept together. In contrast, albino individuals are more sensitive to stress, less aggressive, and, as they are prone to physiological constraints such as impaired vision, are unable to effectively defend resources compared to pigmented phenotypes. Moreover, both these extremely coloured phenotypes are unable to signal their position in the social hierarchy by changing colours, which can result in conflict between their mental state and position in a social hierarchy and/or attempt to change their social rank. In summary, colour variation is a consequence of physiological conditions, especially stress, rather than a cause of such conditions. The breeding and propagation of albino and melanistic fish is generally unethical and should not be considered in aquaculture unless these phenotypes are bred separately under specific conditions, i.e., not kept with typically pigmented conspecifics.},

Blind-side hypermelanosis phenomenon in factory farmed flatfish species Japanese flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, has become the bottleneck against the sustainable development of flatfish farming industry. In the present study, fast and slow flowing water were set up to explore the effects of currents on body color formation in P. olivaceus. The results showed that the number of melanophores increased significantly, and the color becomes significantly darker in the ocular side of the skin under high speed water flow (0.2–0.4 m/s) compared with the micro speed water flow (0.01 m/s) after 50 days. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis determined that melanogenesis related genes, melanocyte inducing transcription factor (mitf) and tyrosinase related protein 1 (tyrp1) increased, and agouti signaling protein 1 (asip1) decreased significantly in the ocular-side skin of fast flowing water group. However, the area of the hypermelanotic skin of the blind side was decreased significantly after high speed water flow treatment. The qRT-PCR validated the significant lower expression mitf and higher expression of asip1 in the whole blind-side skin. Transcriptome sequencing was performed on the ocular-side skin, blind black skin and blind white skin in the fast and slow flowing water group. The aim of the transcriptome analysis was to search for candidate genes potentially involved in the observed pigmentation differences, rather than to perform robust functional enrichment analyses, though, no biological replicates limits the statistical confidence of the detected DEGs. Here differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and are presented as a list of candidate genes for future investigation. We checked the expression of genes related to mechanical force and pigmentation, found that piezo1 and piezo2 were responsible for the darken ocular-side skin after fast water flow treatment. For the blind-side skin, melanogenesis may result from intracellular calcium ion concentration through transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 4 (trpv4) up-expression in response to the contact with the tank bottom but not water flow, than promoted melanin formation through retinoid-POMC pathway. Our results provide new and valuable clues for understanding melanogenesis under different water flow stimulation, especially the significant different response bewteen ocular melanogenesis and blind-side skin hypermelanosis phenomenon in flatfish.},

A large body of evidence indicates the essential role of thyroxine in flatfish metamorphosis, whereas information on cortisol is limited. We administered cortisol to spotted halibut Verasper variegatus larvae in order to examine the effect on pigmentation during metamorphosis. Administration of 10. $\mu$g cortisol per mL of water from before the onset of metamorphosis (stage E) to metamorphic climax (stage G) induced the development of adult type pigment cells on the blind side of the metamorphosed juveniles and increased the occurrence of ambicolored juveniles. When 10. $\mu$g/mL cortisol was administered during stage D, stages E-F, stage G or stage H, only the administration during stages E-F induced the development of adult type pigment cells on the blind side. In addition, the expression of the gene dopachrome tautomerase (dct), a marker of melanoblasts, was enhanced at Stage E by cortisol administration. These results clearly indicated, for the first time, the enhancement of pigmentation by exogenous high-dose cortisol. Since endogenous cortisol is secreted in response to various kinds of stress in rearing conditions, these results indicate a possible influence of stress conditions in the occurrence of ambicoloration in flatfish. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a well-known model organism used in an array of scientific research fields. Many microbiome studies conducted on fishes have focused on gut microbiome diversity. To our knowledge, no investigations into the skin microbiome diversity of pet shop zebrafish have been performed. In this pilot study we aimed to assess the microbiome diversity composition of different groups of zebrafish housed at the Department of Genetics, University of the Free State, South Africa. These fish originated from pet shops located in Bloemfontein, South Africa. We investigated the skin microbiome diversity between wild-type zebrafish and the well-known leopard colour morph. The microbiome compositions between zebrafish sexes were also assessed. No significant differences were observed between colour morphs. A core microbiome was identified for the zebrafish housed at our laboratories. Cetobacterium was significantly more abundant in females compared to males, with Limnobacter more abundant in males. Both these genera are known components of fish microbiomes, including zebrafish. The precise reason for this link should be further investigated.This research adds to the growing knowledge base linked to aquatic microbiome structure in different habitats.},

@article{Seikai1987,
abstract = {The mechanisms for asymmetric skin color formation in the Japanese flounder are studied with particular concerns to causes for pigment disorder (hypomelanosis) occurring under hatchery conditions. For an analysis of normal pigmentation, fish were raised with wild zooplanktons in an indoor hatchery, whilst for hypomelanosis, they were raised with Brazilian Artemia nauplii, a diet used in the hatcheries. Morphological observations, counting of melanophores, histochemical assay of DOPA‐positive immature cells (melanoblasts), and radiometric estimation of tyrosinase activities in skins of developing larvae and juveniles indicate that 1) the structural plan for pigmentation in this species is bilaterally symmetric until metamorphosis, utilizing large‐sized melanophores (hence larval melanophores) as main vehicles, and 2) an asymmetric coloration characteristic to metamorphosed juveniles is formed by an intensive development of smaller‐sized melanophores (hence adult‐type melanophores) appearing selectively in the ocular side at the later stages of metamorphosis and by an absence of it in the blind. These findings apparently indicate that 1) two types of melanophores occur in this species which differ with respect to morphological properties and developmental fate, and 2) selective differentiation of adult type melanophores in the ocular side of the body at or after metamorphosis is primarily responsible for an asymmetric coloration of its adult form. The similar assays on the fish fed with Artemia nauplii indicate that defective development of adult‐type melanophores results in hypomelanosis in their ocular‐sided skins, yielding a pigmentary pattern seen in the blind side of the metamorphosed juveniles with normal pigmentation. Thus, it is likely that some nutritional factor(s) present or deficient in these Artemia nauplii interfere with the development of adult‐type melanophores, possibly through modified tissue environment.

abstract = {Many flatfish species, such as Scophthalmus maximus, Paralichthys olivaceus, Solea senegalensis, are extensively cultured worldwide. In flatfishes, eye migration varies among different species and even within the same species. The genetic mechanism underlying eye migration is still unclear, and it is the key to improve metamorphosis in flatfish aquaculture and understand flatfish evolution. In this study, the high frequency of eye location variants in an artificial S. senegalensis population allowed us to investigate the eye preference during migration; completeness of the eye migration; and other related left-right asymmetric characteristics, such as asymmetrical skull remodeling and lying down on one side. The different frequencies of eye preference during migration, completeness of the eye migration, and settling side suggest that they are determined by different genotypes and imply independent evolutionary events during flatfish evolution. We found that the swimming time may be related to the completeness of eye migration, and further the migration of the eye, the more time the fish spent at the sea bottom. The left-right asymmetric degrees of not only the frontal bones and lateral ethmoids but also the jaw bone, including the premaxillary, maxillary, and dentary bones, depend on the completeness of eye migration. Finally, we proposed a hypothesis for the asymmetric origin of flatfish that provides reasonable explanations for the selective advantages of primitive flatfish species.},

Individual skin pigment cells are clearly visible at hatching, and flounder ontogeny includes a dramatic shift in overall pigmentation (from symmetrical to asymmetrical) during metamorphosis. Moreover, several types of malpigmentation occur in hatchery populations; although much effort has gone into reducing the frequency of such defects, their etiology remains poorly understood, and they have rarely been described at the cellular level.

With a steadily rising demand for fish and fish products, the supply of fish as human food hit a record high in 2008, underlining its significance in contributing to food security and nutrition as a source of high-quality, affordable animal protein in particular. International trade in fish also topped previous values, pointing to the sector's continued important contribution to economic expansion and human well-being. Aquaculture, despite a falling growth rate in recent years, remains the fastest-growing animal-food-producing sector and is set to overtake capture fisheries as a source of food fish. Overall production of the sector continues to grow. This publication analyses and reviews the latest available global statistics and trends in fisheries and aquaculture. It explores the important, yet often underestimated, role of inland fisheries, particularly in many small communities where they make a vital contribution to poverty alleviation and livelihood security. A broader look at the issues affecting fisheries and aquaculture emphasizes the growing need to focus on the many facets of policy and governance and examines the impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss, quality certification and product traceability on the sector},

abstract = {Animals harbour diverse communities of symbiotic bacteria, which differ dramatically among host individuals. This heterogeneity poses an immunological challenge: distinguishing between mutualistic and pathogenic members of diverse and host-specific microbial communities. We propose that Major Histocompatibility class II (MHC) genotypes contribute to recognition and regulation of gut microbes, and thus, MHC polymorphism contributes to microbial variation among hosts. Here, we show that MHC IIb polymorphism is associated with among-individual variation in gut microbiota within a single wild vertebrate population of a small fish, the threespine stickleback. We sampled stickleback from Cedar Lake, on Vancouver Island, and used next-generation sequencing to genotype the sticklebacks' gut microbiota (16S sequencing) and their MHC class IIb exon 2 sequences. The presence of certain MHC motifs was associated with altered relative abundance (increase or decrease) of some microbial Families. The effect sizes are modest and entail a minority of microbial taxa, but these results represent the first indication that MHC genotype may affect gut microbiota composition in natural populations (MHC-microbe associations have also been found in a few studies of lab mice). Surprisingly, these MHC effects were frequently sex-dependent. Finally, hosts with more diverse MHC motifs had less diverse gut microbiota. One implication is that MHC might influence the efficacy of therapeutic strategies to treat dysbiosis-associated disease, including the outcome of microbial transplants between healthy and diseased patients. We also speculate that macroparasite-driven selection on MHC has the potential to indirectly alter the host gut microbiota, and vice versa.},

abstract = {Body coloration in flatfish is one of the most distinctive asymmetries in the animal kingdom, although the fundamental molecular mechanism of the pigmentation is unclear. In the dorso-ventral coloration (countershading) of other teleost fishes, ventral-specific expression of agouti signaling protein 1 (ASIP1), an endogenous antagonist of melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), has been reported to play a pivotal role. Contribution of ASIP1 is also suggested in the asymmetrical pigmentation of flatfish. In order to confirm the contribution of ASIP1 and further examine receptor function in the body coloration of Japanese flounder, expression levels of asip1, mc1r, melanocortin 5 receptor (mc5r), and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor 2 (mchr2) were measured in the normally pigmented area of the left side, the normally non-pigmented area of the right side, and the abnormally pigmented (exhibiting hypermelanosis) area of the right side. Measurement was also carried out under conditions of hypermelanosis stimulated by cortisol and during the transition from non-pigmentation to pigmentation in areas of hypermelanosis. Contrary to our expectations, no difference was detected in asip1 expression between pigmented and non-pigmented areas. There was also no difference between normal and hormonally stimulated pigmented conditions in areas of hypermelanosis or during the transition process. Instead, the expression levels of mc1r, mc5r, and mchr2 were consistently higher in pigmented areas, and were especially increased under hormonally stimulated conditions. In addition, expressions of these receptor genes increased prior to pigmentation in areas of future hypermelanosis. Our results suggest that MC1Rand MC5R, but not necessarily ASIP1, contribute to pigmentation and hypermelanosis in Japanese flounder. We propose a yet unknown molecular mechanism for asymmetrical pigmentation in flatfish that is distinct from that of countershading in other vertebrates.},

abstract = {Background and Aims: Dark spots, brown spots, or hyperpigmented spots (HPS) are oval or irregular brown areas of skin. Their emergence is associated with dysregulation of the immune system, and may also be caused by a deficiency in stromal cell-derived factor-1, leading to perturbed melanogenesis and accumulation of melanosomes within neighboring keratinocytes. The skin microbiota (living microorganisms present on the surface of the skin) is known to play essential roles in maintaining skin homeostasis and in regulating the immune system. Here, we investigated whether the microbiota could play a role in the emergence of HPS. Methods: The clinical study involved 38 European women, selected from among 74 volunteers. Participants were divided into two groups depending on the spot areas measured on their faces. The study was designed to avoid conflicting factors: both groups presented similar skin pH, hydration, transepidermal water loss, and sebum levels. The two cohorts were also age-matched, with a mean of 29-years-old for both. Results: Alpha-diversity of the microbiota was similar for the two groups. On skins with more HPS, seven bacterial genera were identified in significantly higher proportions and included opportunistic pathogens and inflammatory bacteria. Six bacterial genera, including bacteria showing antioxidant and anti-UV properties, were identified in significantly higher proportions on less spotted skins. Cross-domain association networks revealed distinct co-occurrences of genera between the two groups, suggesting nonidentical community structures and exchanges, depending on the HPS status. Conclusion: Our results reveal specific microbiota composition and networks on skins based on HPS status. Changes could alter communication with the immune system, leading to the emergence of dark spots. As an essential part of the overall skin ecosystem, and through its interaction with the skin matrix, the skin microbiota and its maintenance could be considered a new target for skincare applications.},

The ratio of staining area as well as the ratio of ambicolored fish significantly were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the control from days 30 to 60, but significantly increased and evened out by the end of the experiment (P<0.05). In conclusion, we determined that rearing density is not the main cause of the blind-side hypermelanosis, but found that increasing the rearing density can accelerate the ambicoloration in olive flounders. {\textcopyright} The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.},

abstract = {Morphological abnormalities in eye location and/or body coloration are commonly observed in hatchery- reared juveniles of many pleuronectid species, and have become one of the most serious problems in juvenile production for stock enhancement. In this study, these morphological abnormalities of six pleuronectid species- barfin flounder Verasper moseri, slime flounder Microstomus achne, stone flounder Platichthys bicoloratus, starry flounder Pl. stellatus, cresthead flounder Pseudopleuronectes schrenki, and marbled sole Ps. yokohamae-were successfully classified into four morphological types [normal, two types of pseudoalbinism (normal-eye position or top-eye position), and ambicoloration], following the same classification scheme proposed for other two pleuronectids. Based on our results, the characteristics of each morphological type are quite similar among species. It is confirmed that the normal type has the same ocular side and blind side characteristics as those of wild fish, not only in eye position and body coloration, but also in scales or dentition. The pseudoalbino types have the blind side characteristics of wild fish on both sides, with top-eye type in all characteristics, and normal-eye type in all other characteristics other than eye position. The ambicoloration type has all the ocular side characteristics of wild fish on both sides. Therefore, the pseudoalbinism and ambicoloration of hatchery-reared juveniles of pleuronectid species can be considered malformations of asymmetrical formation. Since this process normally occurs during metamorphosis, the term "metamorphosis-related malformation" is proposed for the abnormal formation of juveniles in pleuronectid species. {\textcopyright} The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science 2011.},

In addition, we examined the development of malpigmentation on the blind side of flounder during early development, from 24 to 94 days after hatching (d.a.h.). A total of 60 flounder were collected every 7 d and assessed for quantitative pattern changes in abnormal blind-side pigmentation. The primitive spot and the first patch were visible under a microscope and to the naked eye appeared at 38 d.a.h. (total length [TL] = 18.3 ± 0.4 mm, body weight [BW] = 57.6 ± 4.1 mg) and 45 d.a.h.

The malpigmented patch was composed of adult-type melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores, indicating that it can reversely change its color according to background color, as that on the eyed side in both color and pattern. The pigmented patches subsequently became more distinctive and large in appearance and spread across the entire body on the blind side of the fish. {\textcopyright} by the World Aquaculture Society 2012.},

abstract = {We present here the hologenome theory of evolution, which considers the holobiont (the animal or plant with all of its associated microorganisms) as a unit of selection in evolution. The hologenome is defined as the sum of the genetic information of the host and its microbiota. The theory is based on four generalizations: (1) All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. (2) Symbiotic microorganisms are transmitted between generations. (3) The association between host and symbionts affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment. (4) Variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in either the host or the microbiota genomes; under environmental stress, the symbiotic microbial community can change rapidly. These points taken together suggest that the genetic wealth of diverse microbial symbionts can play an important role both in adaptation and in evolution of higher organisms. During periods of rapid changes in the environment, the diverse microbial symbiont community can aid the holobiont in surviving, multiplying and buying the time necessary for the host genome to evolve. The distinguishing feature of the hologenome theory is that it considers all of the diverse microbiota associated with the animal or the plant as part of the evolving holobiont. Thus, the hologenome theory fits within the framework of the 'superorganism' proposed by Wilson and Sober. {\textcopyright} 2008 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

Pigmented areas on the blind side were measured by an image analyzing system. Flounder from the third condition (sandy substrate with light irradiation) showed the lowest pigmentation on the blind side. In contrast, fish from the second condition (no sandy substrate and no light irradiation), showed the highest pigmentation coverage.

abstract = {Albinism, the loss of melanin pigmentation, has evolved in a diverse variety of cave animals but the responsible evolutionary mechanisms are unknown. In Astyanax mexicanus, which has a pigmented surface dwelling form (surface fish) and several albino cave-dwelling forms (cavefish), albinism is caused by loss of function mutations in the oca2 gene, which operates during the first step of the melanin synthesis pathway. In addition to albinism, cavefish have evolved differences in behavior, including feeding and sleep, which are under the control of the catecholamine system. The catecholamine and melanin synthesis pathways diverge after beginning with the same substrate, L-tyrosine. Here we describe a novel relationship between the catecholamine and melanin synthesis pathways in Astyanax. Our results show significant increases in L-tyrosine, dopamine, and norepinephrine in pre-feeding larvae and adult brains of Pach{\'{o}}n cavefish relative to surface fish. In addition, norepinephrine is elevated in cavefish adult kidneys, which contain the teleost homologs of catecholamine synthesizing adrenal cells. We further show that the oca2 gene is expressed during surface fish development but is downregulated in cavefish embryos. A key finding is that knockdown of oca2 expression in surface fish embryos delays the development of pigmented melanophores and simultaneously increases L-tyrosine and dopamine. We conclude that a potential evolutionary benefit of albinism in Astyanax cavefish may be to provide surplus L-tyrosine as a precursor for the elevated catecholamine synthesis pathway, which could be important for adaptation to the challenging cave environment.},

abstract = {Flatfish have a high market acceptance thus representing a profitable aquaculture production. The main farmed species is the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) followed by Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceous) and tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis), but other species like Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus), Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and common sole (Solea solea) also register an important production and are very promising for farming. Important genomic resources are available for most of these species including whole genome sequencing projects, genetic maps and transcriptomes. In this work, we integrate all available genomic information of these species within a common framework, taking as reference the whole assembled genomes of turbot and tongue sole (> 210 × coverage). New insights related to the genetic basis of productive traits and new data useful to understand the evolutionary origin and diversification of this group were obtained. Despite a general 1:1 chromosome syntenic relationship between species, the comparison of turbot and tongue sole genomes showed huge intrachromosomic reorganizations. The integration of available mapping information supported specific chromosome fusions along flatfish evolution and facilitated the comparison between species of previously reported genetic associations for productive traits. When comparing transcriptomic resources of the six species, a common set of $\sim$ 2500 othologues and $\sim$ 150 common miRNAs were identified, and specific sets of putative missing genes were detected in flatfish transcriptomes, likely reflecting their evolutionary diversification.},

abstract = {Groundbreaking research on the universality and diversity of microorganisms is now challenging the life sciences to upgrade fundamental theories that once seemed untouchable. To fully appreciate the change that the field is now undergoing, one has to place the epochs and foundational principles of Darwin, Mendel, and the modern synthesis in light of the current advances that are enabling a new vision for the central importance of microbiology. Animals and plants are no longer heralded as autonomous entities but rather as biomolecular networks composed of the host plus its associated microbes, i.e., "holobionts." As such, their collective genomes forge a "hologenome," and models of animal and plant biology that do not account for these intergenomic associations are incomplete. Here, we integrate these concepts into historical and contemporary visions of biology and summarize a predictive and refutable framework for their evaluation. Specifically, we present ten principles that clarify and append what these concepts are and are not, explain how they both support and extend existing theory in the life sciences, and discuss their potential ramifications for the multifaceted approaches of zoology and botany. We anticipate that the conceptual and evidence-based foundation provided in this essay will serve as a roadmap for hypothesis-driven, experimentally validated research on holobionts and their hologenomes, thereby catalyzing the continued fusion of biology's subdisciplines. At a time when symbiotic microbes are recognized as fundamental to all aspects of animal and plant biology, the holobiont and hologenome concepts afford a holistic view of biological complexity that is consistent with the generally reductionist approaches of biology.},

Two parallel approaches were applied on the same samples: transcriptionally active bacterial populations were examined based on RNA analysis and were compared with bacterial populations obtained from DNA analysis. Comparison of temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) profiles from DNA and RNA showed important differences, indicating that active bacterial populations were better described by RNA analysis. Results showed that some bacterial groups were significantly (P<0.05) associated with specific families, indicating that microbiota composition may be influenced by the host. In addition, the effect of diet on microbiota composition was dependent on the trout family.},

abstract = {Blind-side hypermelanosis has emerged as a major concern in commercial rearing environments of the flatfish aquaculture industry. To date, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood. To fill this gap, in this study, whole transcriptomic sequencing and analyses were performed using normal skins and hypermelanic skins of the blind side of Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). Differentially expressed long non-coding RNAs (DElncRNAs), miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), and differentially expressed genes as well as their competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were identified. A total of 34 DElncRNAs, 226 DEmiRNAs, and 610 DEGs were identified. Finally, lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA regulatory networks (involving 29 DElncRNAs, 106 DEmiRNAs, and 162 DEGs) associated with blind-side hypermelanosis were constructed. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of 162 DEGs in ceRNA networks identified DEGs (e.g., oca2, mc1r, and ihhb) in pigmentation-related biological processes and DEGs (e.g., ca4, glul, and fut9) in nitrogen metabolism, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, and folate biosynthesis pathways, as well as their corresponding DElncRNAs and DEmiRNAs to potentially play key regulatory roles in blind-side hypermelanosis. In conclusion, this is the first study on the ceRNA regulatory network associated with blind-side hypermelanosis in flatfish. These new findings expand the spectrum of non-coding regulatory mechanisms underpinning blind-side hypermelanosis, which facilitates the further exploration of molecular regulatory mechanisms of malpigmentation in flatfish.},

When should this vocabulary be applied? Are these concepts a null hypothesis for host-microbe systems or limited to a certain spectrum of symbiotic interactions such as host-microbial coevolution? Critical discourse is necessary in this nascent area, but productive discourse requires that skeptics and proponents use the same lexicon. For instance, critiquing the hologenome concept is not synonymous with critiquing coevolution, and arguing that an entity is not a primary unit of selection dismisses the fact that the hologenome concept has always embraced multilevel selection. Holobionts and hologenomes are incontrovertible, multipartite entities that result from ecological, evolutionary, and genetic processes at various levels. They are not restricted to one special process but constitute a wider vocabulary and framework for host biology in light of the microbiome.},

abstract = {The distribution and ultrastructure of pigment cells in skins of normal and albino adult turbots were examined with transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Three types of pigment cells of melanophore, iridophore and xanthophore have been recognized in adult turbot skins. The skin color depends mainly on the amount and distribution of melanophore and iridophore, as xanthophore is quite rare. No pigment cells can be found in the epidermis of the skins. In the pigmented ocular skin of the turbot, melanophore and iridophore are usually co-localized in the dermis. This is quite different from the distribution in larvae skin. In albino and white blind skins of adult turbots, however, only iridophore monolayer still exists, while the melanophore monolayer disappears. This cytological evidence explains why the albino adult turbot, unlike its larvae, could never resume its body color no matter what environmental and nutritional conditions were provided. Endocytosis is quite active in the cellular membrane of the iridophore. This might be related to the formation of reflective platelet and stability of the iridophore. {\textcopyright} 2007 Science Press.},

abstract = {The appearance of the pseudo-albino phenotype was investigated in developing Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis, Kaup 1858) larvae at morphological and molecular levels. In order to induce the development of pseudo-albinos, Senegalese sole larvae were fed Artemia enriched with high levels of arachidonic acid (ARA). The development of their skin pigmentation was compared to that of a control group fed Artemia enriched with a reference commercial product. The relative amount of skin melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores revealed that larval pigmentation developed similarly in both groups. However, results from different relative proportions, allocation patterns, shapes and sizes of skin chromatophores revealed changes in the pigmentation pattern between ARA and control groups from 33 days post hatching onwards. The new populations of chromatophores that should appear at post-metamorphosis were not formed in the ARA group. Further, spatial patterns of distribution between the already present larval xanthophores and melanophores were suggestive of short-range interaction that seemed to be implicated in the degradation of these chromatophores, leading to the appearance of the pseudo-albino phenotype. The expression profile of several key pigmentation-related genes revealed that melanophore development was promoted in pseudo-albinos without a sufficient degree of terminal differentiation, thus preventing melanogenesis. Present results suggest the potential roles of asip1 and slc24a5 genes on the down-regulation of trp1 expression, leading to defects in melanin production. Moreover, gene expression data supports the involvement of pax3, mitf and asip1 genes in the developmental disruption of the new post-metamorphic populations of melanophores, xanthophores and iridophores.},

abstract = {In artificially reared flatfish, especially the Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, pigmented skin (hypermelanosis) frequently appears on the fish's blind side after normal metamorphosis. As no practical prevention method has yet been proposed, we examined the effectiveness of a loose net placed inside the rearing tank that covers the bottom and walls like a pouch. When juveniles (standard length [SL] 6 cm) were transferred to the net-lined tank (mesh size 4 mm) before the first appearance of hypermelanosis, the pigmented area after 2 months covered about 0.5% of the blind side; this is about 1/40th of the area covered by pigment in fish reared in an ordinary tank (20%). Although the initial appearance of pigmentation in the axilla area (the area covered by the pectoral fin) was not suppressed, utilization of a larger mesh size (12 mm) decreased the expansion of pigmentation in this area. Juveniles reared in the net-lined tank were about 5–15% smaller (SL) than those reared in the ordinary tank, but their body depth:SL ratio was closer to that of wild-caught juveniles. From the results of this study, we propose that net-lined rearing tanks with larger-sized mesh are a practical method of preventing hypermelanosis in Japanese flounder aquaculture systems.},

abstract = {The cells dissociated from developing embryos of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) are cultured in vitro to examine the developmental fate of their pigment cells in relation to establishment of bilaterally asymmetric integumental coloration in vivo. When neurula embryos are dissociated using trypsin–EDTA in Dulbecco's modified Ca2+–, Mg2+–free phosphate buffered saline and then cultured in vitro using L–15–based fetal calf serum–supplemented growth medium at 20°C, numerous pigment cells appear twice in the same culture with an interval of approximately 1 month even under similar culture conditions. The first group of pigment cells, which is relatively larger in cell size (about 70 $\mu$m wide) and lower in cell density, emerges within 12 hr after plating, whereas the second, which is far smaller in cell size (about 30 $\mu$m) and overwhelmingly higher in cell density than the first, does so about 1 month after plating. The timing of their appearances in vitro is in good accordance, respectively, with that observed for the larvae under normal development in vivo; the first group appears at the period corresponding to hatching, whereas the second at the period corresponding to the completion of metamorphosis. Light microscopic examinations disclose that each group of pigment cells is composed of black melanophores and reflecting leucophores, and that the population density of melanophores and leucophores in the first group at the climax of appearance is approximated as 1:4. Typical xanthophores that are distributed in the skin of the larvae of this species are scarcely observed in culture in vitro. Because of their dual synchronous appearances with about 1 month interval under the similar culture conditions, and because of their low proliferative activity during the periods from the first appearance to the second, it is presumed that both groups of pigment cells are installed with a clock set differently for their differentiation. Light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry on cultured cells using the HNK–I antibody, which marks avian migratory neural crest cells, both disclose that the antibody cross–reacts with all these pigment cells, and that a certain number of immunoreactive unpigmented cells exist even at the time of the second appearance of pigment cells. These findings would imply that the second group of pigment cells served in a form of undifferentiated propigment cells up to metamorphosis, at which they start to differentiate under control of a clock presumably set during neurulation.

abstract = {To study the relevance of density and background color to stress response, appetite, and growth in olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, we reared two duplicate groups of juveniles (total length 4. 46 ± 0. 06 cm, body weight 0. 77 ± 0. 03 g) in flat-bottom aquaria with dark-green (control) and white backgrounds for 120 days. We measured cortisol and glucose levels in blood and calculated the daily food intake, food conversion efficiency, survival rate, and growth rate. To study the relevance of density and background color to malpigmentation (hypermelanosis) on the blind side, we also compared malpigmented ratios and prepro-melanin-concentrating hormone mRNA activities in the brain between the dark-green and white background groups, as well as between a relatively lower density (60 days) and higher density (120 days). Although we measured relatively higher levels of cortisol and glucose in the white background group and over 200 % of coverage area [PCA]), the bright background failed to induce an acute stress response of more than 20 ng/ml cortisol and 40 mg/dl glucose both in 60 days and 120 days, but did enhance appetite and growth. Also, a bright background color delayed hyperpigmentation only at a low density below 200 % PCA, but did not inhibit malpigmentation at a high density of more than 200 % PCA. In addition, below 200 % PCA, expression of MCH mRNA was significantly higher in the white group, but the level was reversed and was lower in the white group at more than 200 % PCA. In conclusion, although did not induce a high stress response over 200 % PCA, the bright background color resulted in a moderate increasing of cortisol level in blood below 20 ng/ml and enhanced appetite and growth. Moreover, at a density below 200 % PCA, the bright color inhibited hypermelanosis with high MCH mRNA activity, but at more than 200 % PCA did not inhibit malpigmentation, and the fish showed low MCH mRNA activity, indicating that the inhibitory effect of a bright background color on hypermelanosis is density dependent. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

To elucidate the mechanism by which vitamin D3 causes hypermelanosis in Japanese flounder, larvae (total length (TL), 9.8 ± 0.77 mm; 22 days post-hatching (dph)) were fed an artificial diet without any vitamin D supplement (control group), a diet supplemented with 0.5 mg vitamin D 3/100 g (VD3 group), or a diet supplemented with 0.05 mg 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin Dg/100 g (1,25(OH)2D3 group) until 49 dph. Fish were harvested at 49 dph and 70 dph for assessment of the TL, survival, pigmentation, and vertebral deformity. A high incidence of hypermelanosis on the blind side was observed on the head and caudal regions in all groups at both 49 dph and 70 dph. A significantly higher frequency of occurrence of severe hypermelanosis on the trunk region of the blind side was observed in the 1,25(OH)2D3 group (P < 0.05) compared with the control group at 70 dph. Moreover, completely hyperpigmented fish were observed only in the 1,25(OH)2D3 group. A higher frequency of the occurrence of winding of the abdominal vertebrae was also observed in the VD3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 groups (P < 0.05).},

abstract = {We examined the effect of dietary arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA) on growth, survival, pigmentation and fatty acid composition of Senegal sole larvae using a dose-response design. From 3 to 37 days post-hatch (dph), larvae were fed live food (rotifers from 3 to 9 dph, Artemia nauplii from -37 dph) that had been enriched using one of three experimental emulsions containing 3 graduated concentrations (1.3, 68 and 120.1 mg ARA g-1 dry weight) of ARA and constant docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA). A commercial enrichment product (DHA-Protein Selco, ARA content 7.8 mg g-1 dry weight) was used as a reference diet. Final concentration of ARA in Artemia nauplii ranged from 0.2 to 17.5 mg g-1 lipids. Growth and survival were independent of dietary levels of ARA tested. However, there was a correlation between dietary ARA and a significant reduction in pigmentation leading to increased albinism. Tissue fatty acid concentrations reflected the corresponding dietary composition. Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA) levels in all the tissues examined were inversely related to dietary ARA. There was almost a 100-fold increase in the proportion of docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3, DPA) in the tissues relative to the diet, which might indicate chain elongation from EPA as a result of inadequate dietary DHA. A negative, linear correlation was found between the pigmentation rate and the ARA content in the head, as well as with dietary ARA/EPA ratio. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Mortality was highest among the halibut reared in units with a bottom substrate of sand. This may be attributed to poor water quality in this system. Growth rates were highest for the halibut reared in units with silicone ridges. After 3 months the juveniles reared in units with a smooth bottom had developed external skin lesions on the caudal peduncle and on the mid-body area of the abocular side. Simultaneously there was hyperpigmentation of the outer margins of the body and head region on the abocular side. The external skin lesions and patches of hyperpigmentation increased in size and number as time progressed. By the end of the experiment the numbers of halibut with external skin lesions and hyperpigmentation of the abocular side were significantly higher amongst fish held in the units with a smooth bottom than amongst those reared in the other two systems. The coincidence of external skin lesions and hyperpigmentation with reduced growth suggests a negative effect of these skin problems on growth rates in halibut.},

abstract = {Most flatfish, of the order Pleuronectiformes, possess a white lower side, and a brown or grey upper side. This upper side can display integumentary patterning with dark areas and colored or white spots. Chromatophores in flatfish are dermal and epidermal melanophores, as well as dermal xanthophores, erythrophores, iridophores, and leucophores, combinations of which contribute to the color and patterning. Cellular studies demonstrate pattern-related differences in numerical distribution between the types of chromatophores, and in their size, both of which will enhance contrast between areas of the pattern. As well as these morphological characteristics, there are also clear physiological differences, with melanophores from various areas of the patterns demonstrating differential responsiveness to background and to stress/excitement stimuli. Regulation of flatfish melanophore responses is predominantly neural, through the sympathetic nervous system; the pituitary hormones in these fish function in maintaining final equilibria in physiological adaptations to backgrounds. Melanophores from main components of patterns also respond differently in vitro to electrical stimulation, to pituitary hormones, and to sympathomimetic drugs and their antagonists. Sensitivity characteristics with $\alpha$- and $\beta$-adrenergic pharmacological reagents in vitro indicate the existence of a pattern-related balance in $\alpha$- and $\beta$-adrenoceptor mediation in melanophore regulation. The patterning mechanism is complex, with both morphological and physiological differences at the chromatophore level, as well as involvement of central processing and control, which remains to be analysed. {\textcopyright} 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {Fish skin is a multi-purpose tissue that serves numerous vital functions including chemical and physical protection, sensory activity, behavioural purposes or hormone metabolism. Further, it is an important first-line defense system against pathogens, as fish are continuously exposed to multiple microbial challenges in their aquatic habitat. Fish skin excels in highly developed antimicrobial features, many of which have been preserved throughout evolution, and infection defense principles employed by piscine skin are still operative in human skin. This review argues that it is both rewarding and important for investigative dermatologists to revive their interest in fish skin biology, as it provides insights into numerous fundamental issues that are of major relevance to mammalian skin. The basic molecular insights provided by zebrafish in vivo-genomics for genetic, regeneration and melanoma research, the complex antimicrobial defense systems of fish skin and the molecular controls of melanocyte stem cells are just some of the fascinating examples that illustrate the multiple potential uses of fish skin models in investigative dermatology. We synthesize the essentials of fish skin biology and highlight selected aspects that are of particular comparative interest to basic and clinically applied human skin research. {\textcopyright} 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract = {The barramundi (Lates calcarifer), a significant aquaculture species, typically displays silver to bronze coloration. However, attention is now drawn to rare variants like the “panda” phenotype, characterized by blotch-like patterns of black (PB) and golden (PG) patches. This phenotype presents an opportunity to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying color variations in teleosts. Unlike stable color patterns in many fish, the “panda” variant demonstrates phenotypic plasticity, responding dynamically to unknown cues. We propose a complex interplay of genetic factors and epigenetic modifications, focusing on DNA methylation. Through a multiomics approach, we analyze transcriptomic and methylation patterns between PB and PG patches. Our study reveals differential gene expression related to melanosome trafficking and chromatophore differentiation. Although the specific gene responsible for the PB–PG difference remains elusive, candidate genes like asip1, asip2, mlph, and mreg have been identified. Methylation emerges as a potential contributor to the “panda” phenotype, with changes in gene promoters like hand2 and dynamin possibly influencing coloration. This research lays the groundwork for further exploration into rare barramundi color patterns, enhancing our understanding of color diversity in teleosts. Additionally, it underscores the “panda” phenotype's potential as a model for studying adult skin coloration.},

abstract = {Three experiments were carried out to clarify the effect of thyroid hormones on the pigmentation of larval Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. The first two experiments were conducted to investigate the critical concentration of thyroxine (T4) which causes abnormal pigmentation, and the third was to determine the sensitive stage of larval development at which albinism is induced by exogenous T4. The larvae treated with over 10 nM T4 showed a significant increase of albinism in Experiments 1 (concentration: 0, 1, 10, 50 nM) and Experiment 2 (concentration: 0, 1, 5, 10 nM). In Experiment 3, seven groups were immersed in 10 nM T4 at specific stages: between A and B, C and D, E and F, G and I, C and F and A and F. The groups of hormonal treatment at stages E and F (prometamorphosis) produced more than 90% albinism, indicating that differentiation of adult-type melanophores took place at this point. Another 4 groups of larvae were separately treated with levels of 10 nM T4 at stages A and B, C and D, E and F and G to I. T4 content of larvae increased corresponding to the developmental stage 180 ng/g-wet weight in A and B, 740 in C and D, and 1350 in E and F, but decreased to 130 in stage G to I (n=3, p<0.01). Changes in the body content of T4 were reflected in the groups with higher incidence of albinism. The present experiment has revealed the T4 sensitive period for the induction of albinism in Japanese flounder. The absence of normal coloration in the juveniles after T4 treatment clearly indicates the involvement of the thyroid in pigmentation at the early stages of development.},

abstract = {When flatfishes are cultured at high-density in an artificial facility, the bright background color and the carpeted bottom substratum (sand or gravel) help significantly to enhance growth and prevent blind-side hypermelanosis. However, how the bright background and carpeted gravel enhance growth and prevent the hypermelanosis is unknown. Thus, we performed three experiments using the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus. In the first, the acupressure of gravel to blind skin and the burrowing behavior of flounder were assessed to determine which eventually suppressed hypermelanosis. In the second experiment, we assessed whether the color of the carpeted gravel affected flounder hypermelanosis and growth. In the final experiment, we assessed whether hypermelanosis of flounder reared on a gravel bottom was continuously inhibited after removal of the gravel substratum, and whether tank color affected the hypermelanosis and fish growth. The results showed that the burrowing of flounder into gravel was more important than the stimulus of rough gravel on blind-skin to prevent blind-side hypermelanosis. The color of the gravel and tanks did not affect hypermelanosis. Removal of the gravel substratum resulted in enhancement of blind-side hypermelanosis. However, fish growth was enhanced by a bright-colored tank but not a bright-colored bottom substratum. In conclusion, these results confirm that the absence of shelter in which flounder can burrow or hide induces blind-side hypermelanosis, and that flounder consistently burrow beneath the substratum to prevent malpigmentation. Additionally, our results show that a bright-colored tank resulted in increased growth, indicating that flounder should be reared in a bright-background to enhance growth. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Oscar Astronotus ocellatus is an important ornamental fish, including albino and wild varieties. Albino individuals attract aquarium hobbyists due to their unique body color, but studies on the species' albinism mechanism are currently scarce. Here, we investigated the morphological and transcriptomic profiles of the skin of albino and wild Oscar. The results showed that the albino type had fewer oval-shaped melanophores and immature melanosomes but that the wild type contained more stellate-shaped melanophores and mature melanosomes. Albino Oscar had a degenerative pigment layer without obvious melanin deposition and content, while the wild type contained more concentrated melanin within the pigment layer. A total of 272,392 unigenes were detected, 109 of which were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between albino and wild Oscar. Pathways of DEGs, including those involved in complement and coagulation cascades, novobiocin biosynthesis, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, and tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis, were significantly enriched. DEGs, including upregulated Sfrp5 and Tat, and downregulated Wnt-10a, Ppp3c, Notch1 and Trim27 involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, Notch signaling pathway, tyrosine metabolism, MAPK signaling pathway and melanogenesis, might be associated with the albinism of Oscar. This study characterized the difference in melanophore morphology between wild and albino Oscar and identified some albinism-related candidate genes and signaling pathways, helping to understand the genetic mechanism of fish albinism.},

abstract = {The effect of different lipid compositions of live feed on the survival, growth rate and pigmentation success of turbot larvae, Scophthalmus maximus (L.), was investigated. Rotifers, Brachionus plicatilis, together with the algae Tetraselmis sp., were administered until day 12, and Artemia was fed until day 27. The experimentally treated live feeds were enriched with four formulated emulsions, resulting in a gradient in the relative contents of $\Omega$3 HUFA (highly unsaturated fatty acids) and in DHA (docosahexaenoic acid, 22:6 $\Omega$3)/EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid, 20:5 $\Omega$3) ratios in both the rotifers and Artemia. There were no differences in larval growth rate, and only small differences in survival rate throughout the feeding experiment, probably because of satisfactory levels of $\Omega$3 HUFA in the live feed to sustain growth and survival. A correlation was obtained between the percentage of completely pigmented 27 d old turbot and the DHA/EPA ratio in the total lipids of 12 d old larvae, which again was correlated with the corresponding ratio in the live feed used. The results suggest that normal pigmentation in turbot requires dietary DHA in the early larval feeding period, and that this requirement cannot be replaced by EPA. {\textcopyright} 1994, Chapman & Hall.

abstract = {Albinism, a phenomenon characterized by pigmentation deficiency on the ocular side of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), has caused significant damage. Limited mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) information is available on fish pigmentation deficiency. In this study, a high-throughput sequencing strategy was employed to identify the mRNA and miRNAs involved in P. olivaceus albinism. Based on P. olivaceus genome, RNA-seq identified 21,787 know genes and 711 new genes by transcripts assembly. Of those, 235 genes exhibited significantly different expression pattern (fold change ≥2 or ≤0.5 and q-value≤0.05), including 194 down-regulated genes and 41 up-regulated genes in albino versus normally pigmented individuals. These genes were enriched to 81 GO terms and 9 KEGG pathways (p≤0.05). Among those, the pigmentation related pathways-Melanogenesis and tyrosine metabolism were contained. High-throughput miRNA sequencing identified a total of 475 miRNAs, including 64 novel miRNAs. Furthermore, 33 differentially expressed miRNAs containing 13 up-regulated and 20 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in albino versus normally pigmented individuals (fold change ≥1.5 or ≤0.67 and p≤0.05). The next target prediction discovered a variety of putative target genes, of which, 134 genes including Tyrosinase (TYR), Tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) were overlapped with differentially expressed genes derived from RNA-seq. These target genes were significantly enriched to 254 GO terms and 103 KEGG pathways (p<0.001). Of those, tyrosine metabolism, lysosomes, phototransduction pathways, etc., attracted considerable attention due to their involvement in regulating skin pigmentation. Expression patterns of differentially expressed mRNA and miRNAs were validated in 10 mRNA and 10 miRNAs by qRT-PCR. With high-throughput mRNA and miRNA sequencing and analysis, a series of interested mRNA and miRNAs involved in fish pigmentation are identified. And the miRNA-mRNA regulatory network also provides a solid starting point for further elucidation of fish pigmentation deficiency.},

Larval flounder of 9–10 days post-hatching (5.50±0.32 mm TL) which had been fed initially with only rotifers were given one of 3 different strains of Artemia nauplii mixed with rotifers until the flounder's completion of metamorphosis. Then the percentage occurrence of albinism was compared among 3 groups of flounder (BA, TA and SA) fed respectively on Artemia nauplii in Brazil, Tien-tsin and San Francisco. The percentage occurrence of albinism was highest (99.5-100.0%) in BA, intermediate (81.3-84.6%) in TA and lowest (21.1-26.1%) in SA. Population density, feeding level and the other rearing conditions in BA were almost the same as those in SA. These results suggest a close relationship between some chemical components of Artemia nauplii and the occurrence of albinism in flounder. However, principal factors in Artemia responsible for abnormal coloration were not specified from the difference of chemical components among these 3 different strains in terms of minerals, heavy metals, lipid class, fatty acids and residual pesticides. {\textcopyright} 1987, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

In the turbot skin, three morphologically distinct layers were identified: epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. The epidermis was non-keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium that varies in thickness from 5 to 14 cells and 60 to 100. $\mu$m in size. Goblet cells were seen randomly distributed between malpighian cells in the epidermal layer. These mucous cells were mainly located in the upper third of the epidermis and displayed a spherical to elongated morphology. Dermis was divided in two well-differentiated layers, the superficial stratum laxum and the deeper stratum compactum. Hypodermis was a loose layer mainly composed by adipocytes but we could observe variable amounts of fibroblast, collagen and blood vessels. In turbot two pigmentary layers could be identified: the pigmentary layer of dermis was located between basement membrane and dermis and the pigmentary layer of hypodermis immediately above the muscular layer. Three different types of chromatophores were present: melanophores, iridophores and xanthophores. The main differences observed between groups of fish with different colouration were in the amount of melanophores and xanthophores. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of normal cutaneous biology prior to consideration of specific cutaneous alterations and diseases in turbot.},

Host diet is known to alter microbiota composition, implying that dietary treatments might alleviate diseases arising from altered microbial composition (‘dysbiosis'). However, it remains unclear whether diet effects are general or depend on host genotype. Here we show that gut microbiota composition depends on interactions between host diet and sex within populations of wild and laboratory fish, laboratory mice and humans. Within each of two natural fish populations (threespine stickleback and Eurasian perch), among-individual diet variation is correlated with individual differences in gut microbiota. However, these diet–microbiota associations are sex dependent. We document similar sex-specific diet–microbiota correlations in humans. Experimental diet manipulations in laboratory stickleback and mice confirmed that diet affects microbiota differently in males versus females. The prevalence of such genotype by environment (sex by diet) interactions implies that therapies to treat dysbiosis might have sex-specific effects. Diet variations can alter gut microbial composition, but the potential influence of host genetic factors on these effects is unclear. Here, the authors show, in humans and in natural and laboratory fish populations, that such effects are dependent on the host's sex, a genetically determined factor.},

We tested the hypothesis that pigmentation abnormalities are an overt signal of more generalised modifications in tissue structure and function, using as a model the Senegalese sole and two important innate immune barriers, the skin and intestine, and their microbiomes. Stereological analyses in pseudo-albino sole revealed a significantly increased mucous cell number in skin (P < 0.001) and a significantly thicker muscle layer and lamina propria in gut (P < 0.001). RNA-seq transcriptome analysis of the skin and gut identified 573 differentially expressed transcripts (DETs, FDR < 0.05) between pseudo-albino and pigmented soles (one pool/tissue from 4 individuals/phenotype). DETs were mainly linked to pigment production, skin structure and regeneration and smooth muscle contraction. The microbiome (16 S rRNA analysis) was highly diverse in pigmented and pseudo-albino skin but in gut had low complexity and diverged between the two pigmentation phenotypes. Quantitative PCR revealed significantly lower loads of Mycoplasma (P < 0.05) and Vibrio bacteria (P < 0.01) in pseudo-albino compared to the control. The study revealed that pseudo-albinism in addition to pigmentation changes was associated with generalised changes in the skin and gut structure and a modification in the gut microbiome.},

However, although the Cantabrian turbot sector has been moderately successful, it has been the Atlantic region that has consolidated its hegemony over the years. The social-ecological system framework is an appropriate instrument to identify the key variables that have displayed heterogeneous behavior across regions, given their transdisciplinary, adaptive and multiscale nature. In this study, a comparative analysis is made through the first-tier categories (Resource Systems, Governance Systems and Actors) and their second-level variables, which present differences between regions. The results show that both the ecological and social systems have performed better in the Atlantic region. Its adequate environmental characteristics, together with the incentives generated by the actors of the governance system, promote interactions that build scenarios conducive to the success of the Galician turbot sector.},

@article{Bolker2000,
abstract = {Malpigmentation is common in hatchery‐reared flatfishes, decreasing the market value of whole fish, and increasing the risk of predation for juveniles released to enhance wild stocks. Pigmentation development in flatfishes occurs in two phases. First, during embryonic and larval stages pigment cells differentiate on both sides of the body. Second, at metamorphosis larval melanophores disappear, and adult melanophores differentiate on the ocular but not on the blind side. Malpigmentation seems to result from disruptions of the second phase, and may take the form of albinism on the ocular side or darkening of the blind side. Both types of aberration may be related to aspects of the hatchery environment such as lighting, substratum, and diet. Larval nutrition appears to be a key factor and enrichment of larval diets with fatty acids and Vitamin A can greatly reduce malpigmentation rates; however, levels suffcient to prevent pigmentation defects frequently cause other abnormalities. Two developmental explanations for albinism have been proposed. The first is that differentiation of ocular‐side skin follows the normal blind‐side pathway and adult melanophores therefore fail to develop on the ocular side. The second hypothesis suggests that dietary deficiencies inhibit retinal development and the resulting visual defects lead to failure of a hormonal signal required for melanophore differentiation. These hypotheses may well be complementary; as yet neither has been thoroughly tested. Definitive tests will require a combination of manipulative techniques such as tissue transplantation and cell culture with nutritional, behavioural and hormonal assays.

abstract = {A pleuronectiform fish, the barfin flounder, Verasper moseri, is promising for aquaculture and resource enhancement in Northern Japan due to its high commercial value. A major problem in the aquaculture is staining (pigmentation of the skin on non-eyed side) under culture conditions since it diminishes the commercial value of the fish. Melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) is a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus which turns the body of teleosts pale. Here, we examined the employment of MCH to prevent staining. Bolus injection of MCH (1 $\mu$g/g body weight (BW)) in barfin flounder turned the stained area pale. The occurrence of staining was suppressed by injection of MCH (1 $\mu$g/g BW, once a week, total 10 times). These results indicated that MCH affected the non-eyed side color in addition to the physiological color change on the eyed side. Then, we prepared juvenile fish having no staining by rearing with a tank containing Microceramic on the bottom and transferred them to white, yellow, or black tanks without Microceramic. Eight months later, the percent area of each fish that is stained in white or yellow tanks was significantly smaller than that of fish reared in a black tank. The number of MCH-immunoreactive cell bodies in the brain was significantly greater in the white tank fish than that of the black tank fish, suggesting that white background enhanced the secretion of endogenous MCH, by which occurrence of staining was prevented. Interestingly, both the total length and body weight of the white-reared fish were greater than those of the black-reared fish, respectively. The enhanced production of MCH might augment the food intake of barfin flounders as in mammals, so that the somatic growth of the fish is promoted. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Turbot larvae were fed live-prey enriched with different levels of arachidonic (ARA) and eicosapentaenoic (EPA) acids to study the effects of these fatty acids on body composition and pigmentation success. Significantly reduced pigmentation was obtained in those fish fed medium and high ARA diets for 43 days. Growth and survival were the same for all groups. The incorporation of ARA and EPA in fish eyes, brains, livers and carcasses reflected the percentage of these fatty acids in the diets. ARA accumulation was similar in all tissues, but brain accumulated EPA was less efficient than the other tissues examined. A highly significant, negative correlation was found between the %ARA in turbot juvenile brain total lipids and pigmentation success. A weaker, positive correlation was found between brain EPA and pigmentation. Increasing dietary ARA affected the fatty acid composition of turbot brain phosphoglycerides more than increasing dietary EPA, especially in phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). A negative relationship was found between percentage normal pigmentation and ARA levels in brain phosphatidylcholine (PC), PE and phosphatidylserine (PS). Elevated levels of ARA in PI also resulted in malpigmented juveniles, but EPA:ARA ratios ≥ 1 in PI were associated with normal pigmentation. We conclude that, given a sufficiency of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the optimum dietary level of EPA is not a function of DHA, but of dietary ARA.},

abstract = {Live feed enrichments are often used in fish larvicultures as an optimized source of essential nutrients to improve larval growth and survival. In addition to this, they may also play an important role in structuring larval-associated microbial communities and may help improve their resistance to diseases. However, there is limited information available on how larval microbial communities and larviculture water are influenced by different live feed enrichments. In the present study, we investigated the effects of two commercial rotifer enrichments (ER) on turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) larval and post-larval gut-associated bacterial communities during larviculture production. We evaluated their effects on bacterial populations related to known pathogens and beneficial bacteria and their potential influence on the composition of bacterioplankton communities during larval rearing. High-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing was used to assess the effects of different rotifer enrichments (ER1 and ER2) on the structural diversity of bacterial communities of the whole turbot larvae 10 days after hatching (DAH), the post-larval gut 30 DAH, and the larviculture water. Our results showed that different rotifer feed enrichments were associated with significant differences in bacterial composition of turbot larvae 10 DAH, but not with the composition of larval gut communities 30 DAH or bacterioplankton communities 10 and 30 DAH. However, a more in-depth taxonomic analysis showed that there were significant differences in the abundance of Vibrionales in both 10 DAH larvae and in the 30 DAH post-larval gut fed different RE diets. Interestingly, the ER1 diet had a higher relative abundance of specific amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) related to potential Vibrio-antagonists belonging to the Roseobacter clade (e.g., Phaeobacter and Ruegeria at 10 DAH and Sulfitobacter at 30 DAH). In line with this, the diet was also associated with a lower relative abundance of Vibrio and a lower mortality. These results suggest that rotifer diets can affect colonization by Vibrio members in the guts of post-larval turbot. Overall, this study indicates that live feed enrichments can have modulatory effects on fish bacterial communities during the early stages of development, which includes the relative abundances of pathogenic and antagonist taxa in larviculture systems.},

abstract = {Interest in the culture of flatfishes has increased globally due to high consumer demand and decreased commercial landings. The Southern flounder Paralichthys lethostigma inhabit South Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico waters and support important commercial and recreational fisheries. In spring, 1996, a two-part larval rearing study was performed with Southern flounder to examine the effects of three larval diets and two light intensities on survival, growth, and pigmentation. The first part of the study consisted of feeding 6 d Post-hatch (dph) (3.0 ± 0.1 mm TL) larvae three diets: 1) rotifers Brachionus plicatilis at a rate of 10/mL from day 1-9 and Artemia nauplii (3/mL) from day 7 through metamorphosis; 2) rotifers fed day 1 through metamorphosis and Artemia fed day 7 through metamorphosis; or 3) same diet as treatment 1 plus a commercial larval diet added day 13 through metamorphosis. The second part of the study examined the effects of two light levels: low-light (mean 457 lux) and high-light (mean 1362 lux). At 24 C, metamorphosis began on day 23 (mean fish size 8.2 ± 0.6 mm TL) in all treatments and was completed by day 30. Analysis of survival, size, and pigmentation data indicated there were no significant differences among feed treatments or between light treatments. Overall survival was 33.4% (± 15.9) and mean length was 11.5 mm TL ± 1.3 Only 35% of the larvae were normally pigmented. Reexamination of the pigmentation on day 37 indicated fish reared at the low light intensity through metamorphosis (day 30) but exposed to high light intensity for 1 wk post-metamorphosis had become significantly more pigmented.},

The enriched Artemia were fed to the larvae from 27 to 31 days post hatching (dph) corresponding to the F-G stage. VA palmitate, retinol and retinoic acid (RA) contents of Artemia were correlatively elevated with increasing VA palmitate in the culture medium. RA was detected in Artemia enriched with 5 mg and 10 mg, and a significantly high frequency of hypermelanosis on the blind side was observed in these groups at 65 dph (P < 0.05).

abstract = {Major histocompatibility (MHC) immune system genes may evolve in response to pathogens in the environment. Because they also may affect mate choice, they are candidates for having great importance in ecological speciation. Here, we use next-generation sequencing to test the general hypothesis of parallelism in patterns of MHCII$\beta$ diversity and bacterial infections among five dwarf and normal whitefish sympatric pairs. A second objective was to assess the functional relationships between specific MHCII$\beta$ alleles and pathogens in natural conditions. Each individual had between one and four alleles, indicating two paralogous loci. In Cliff Lake, the dwarf ecotype was monomorphic for the most common allele. In Webster Lake, the skew in the allelic distribution was towards the same allele but in the normal ecotype, underscoring the nonparallel divergence among lakes. Our signal of balancing selection matched putative peptide binding region residues in some cases, but not in others, supporting other recent findings of substantial functional differences in fish MHCII$\beta$ compared with mammals. Individuals with fewer alleles were less likely to be infected; thus, we found no evidence for the heterozygote advantage hypothesis. MHCII$\beta$ alleles and pathogenic bacteria formed distinct clusters in multivariate analyses, and clusters of certain alleles were associated with clusters of pathogens, or sometimes the absence of pathogens, indicating functional relationships at the individual level. Given that patterns of MHCII$\beta$ and bacteria were nonparallel among dwarf and normal whitefish pairs, we conclude that pathogens driving MHCII$\beta$ evolution did not play a direct role in their parallel phenotypic evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Regulation of intestinal dietary fat absorption is critical to maintaining energy balance. While intestinal microbiota clearly impact the host's energy balance, their role in intestinal absorption and extraintestinal metabolism of dietary fat is less clear. Using in vivo imaging of fluorescent fatty acid (FA) analogs delivered to gnotobiotic zebrafish hosts, we reveal that microbiota stimulate FA uptake and lipid droplet (LD) formation in the intestinal epithelium and liver. Microbiota increase epithelial LD number in a diet-dependent manner. The presence of food led to the intestinal enrichment of bacteria from the phylum Firmicutes. Diet-enriched Firmicutes and their products were sufficient to increase epithelial LD number, whereas LD size was increased by other bacterial types. Thus, different members of the intestinal microbiota promote FA absorption via distinct mechanisms. Diet-induced alterations in microbiota composition might influence fat absorption, providing mechanistic insight into how microbiota-diet interactions regulate host energy balance. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the now-documented influence of the metagenome on experimental results and the reproducibility of in vivo mammalian models present new challenges. Here we provide the scientific basis for calling on all investigators, editors and funding agencies to embrace changes that will enhance reproducible and interpretable experiments by accounting for metagenomic effects. Implementation of new reporting and experimental design principles will improve experimental work, speed discovery and translation, and properly use substantial investments in biomedical research. This work highlights the critical challenges in experimental design and interpretation due to important combinatorial effects of host and microbial genes, and calls for the development of minimal reporting requirements to improve the interpretation and reproducibility of experimental biology. Recent studies have indicated that differences in mammalian genetics explain only a fraction of observed phenotypic variation. The microbiome — principally its bacterial, viral and fungal components — is also of great importance in determining physiological responses. In this Perspective, Thaddeus Stappenbeck and Herbert Virgin highlight the need for experimental design and interpretation that takes account of the interactions between host and microbiome genes, focusing on the workhorse of genetic and medical research, the laboratory mouse.},

abstract = {Alike other flat fish, marine turbot has the particularity that changes from larvae with bilateral symmetry to adult with asymmetry, in terms of the position of the eyes. As expected, the skin configuration of this species is also affected by the development and transformation suffered by fish during metamorphosis. In this context, changes in the epidermis of marine turbot were studied using conventional staining and histochemical techniques using six lectins (UEA-I, PNA, RCA-I, WGA, Con A and SBA). During development from larvae to juvenile (3–300 days post-hatching), the epidermis increased in both thickness and the number of cell layers. In fact, the simple cuboidal epithelium observed in larvae at day 3 already became stratified at days 10–12, which sequentially increase in thickness with fish development. Turbot epidermis is composed basically of four cell types: epithelial and mucous or secretory cells that are present through the development, and pigmented cells and a type that the authors described as club-like cells that appear during and post-metamorphosis. The Alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff (AB-PAS) histochemical method revealed the presence of neutral glycoconjugates in mucous and club-like cells at post-metamorphic stages of fish. Accordingly, lectin analysis showed mucous cells containing glycoproteins rich in fucose (UEA-I labelling) and glycoconjugates rich in the sequence galactose-N-acetyl galactosamine (PNA and RCA-I labelling) when this cell type appears. Interestingly, melanophores were observed in the dorsal epidermis of post-metamorphic juveniles. This type of cell contains a black-to-brown pigment that provides the skin the typical colour of this fish species. Changes in mucous coat composition were observed during fish development, which was attributed to different roles of the glycoconjugates.},

abstract = {Metagenomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses was applied to unveil the taxonomic composition and functional diversity of the farmed adult turbot gastrointestinal (GI) microbiome. Proteobacteria and Firmicutes which existed in both GI content and mucus were dominated in the turbot GI microbiome. 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses also indicated that the turbot GI tract may harbor some bacteria which originated from associated seawater. Functional analyses indicated that the clustering-based subsystem and many metabolic subsystems were dominant in the turbot GI metagenome. Compared with other gut metagenomes, quorum sensing and biofilm formation was overabundant in the turbot GI metagenome. Genes associated with quorum sensing and biofilm formation were found in species within Vibrio, including Vibrio vulnificus, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In farmed fish gut metagenomes, the stress response and protein folding subsystems were over-represented and several genes concerning antibiotic and heavy metal resistance were also detected. These data suggested that the turbot GI microbiome may be affected by human factors in aquaculture. Additionally, iron acquisition and the metabolism subsystem were more abundant in the turbot GI metagenome when compared with freshwater fish gut metagenome, suggesting that unique metabolic potential may be observed in marine animal GI microbiomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

abstract = {A pleuronectiform fish, the barfin flounder Verasper moseri, reared in a white tank had a smaller ratio of pigmented area of the skin on non-eyed side, grew faster, and had greater melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)-immunoreactive cell bodies and MCH gene expression in the brain than in the black tank, indicating that synthesis and release of MCH are higher in fish from a white tank. In the present study, a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay for MCH was developed. MCH levels were assessed in the brain, pituitary gland, and plasma of barfin flounders reared in a white or black tank. A competitive assay using two antibodies was performed among secondary antibodies in the solid phase, MCH antibodies, samples, and europium-labeled MCH. Displacement curves of serially diluted extracts (brain, pituitary gland, and plasma) of the barfin flounder paralleled that of the MCH standard. MCH levels in the brain and plasma were higher in fish reared in the white tank for 5 months than in the black tank. These results suggest that synthesis and secretion of MCH are enhanced with the white background and that MCH is involved in both somatic growth and the skin pigmentation in the barfin flounder. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We describe a stepwise series of three experiments aimed at reducing pseudoalbinism and ambicoloration in cultured California halibut (Paralichthys californicus). Pigmentation was assessed between 49 and 56 days post hatch when reared at 18–19 °C. Manipulation of rotifer enrichments was tested initially to reduce malpigmentation, with up to 10.8 ± 3.8% of fish being normally pigmented. Dietary timing was subsequently examined, with late introduction of Artemia yielding the highest rate of normal pigmentation (40.6 ± 8.6%) and eliminating ambicoloration. Rearing temperature was further shown to influence malpigmentation, with the most normally-pigmented fish occurring at 15 °C (46.3 ± 2.7%) and the fewest at 23 °C (5.7 ± 1.0%). Continued efforts to eliminate malpigmentation, in particular pseudoalbinism, during intensive larviculture of California halibut will focus on additional modifications of key nutritional and environmental parameters.},

abstract = {The Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is a flatfish with distinctive asymmetry in its body coloration. The melanism (hyperpigmentation) in both the blind side and ocular side of C. semilaevis gives it an extremely low commercial value. However, the fundamental molecular mechanism of this melanism remains unclear. Melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R), a GTP-binding protein-coupled receptor, is considered to play a vital role in the physiology of the vertebrate pigment system. In order to confirm the contribution of MC1R to the body coloration of C. semilaevis, the expression levels of Mc1r mRNA were measured in seven tissue types at different developmental stages of normal and melanistic C. semilaevis. The expression levels of Mc1r mRNA in the heart, brain, liver, kidney, ocular-side skin, and blind-side skin of melanistic C. semilaevis were significantly higher than that of normal C. semilaevis in all developmental stages. Moreover, the knocking down of Mc1r in the C. semilaevis liver cell line (HTLC) increased the expression of the downstream genes microphthalmia transcription factor (Mitf) and tyrosinase-related protein 1 (Tyrp1) in the pigmentation pathway. Thus, the present data suggest that MC1R might play important roles in Tyrp1- and Mitf-mediated pigment synthesis in C. semilaevis.},

abstract = {Advancing the production efficiency and profitability of aquaculture is dependent upon the ability to utilize a diverse array of genetic resources. The ultimate goals of aquaculture genomics, genetics and breeding research are to enhance aquaculture production efficiency, sustainability, product quality, and profitability in support of the commercial sector and for the benefit of consumers. In order to achieve these goals, it is important to understand the genomic structure and organization of aquaculture species, and their genomic and phenomic variations, as well as the genetic basis of traits and their interrelationships. In addition, it is also important to understand the mechanisms of regulation and evolutionary conservation at the levels of genome, transcriptome, proteome, epigenome, and systems biology. With genomic information and information between the genomes and phenomes, technologies for marker/causal mutation-assisted selection, genome selection, and genome editing can be developed for applications in aquaculture. A set of genomic tools and resources must be made available including reference genome sequences and their annotations (including coding and non-coding regulatory elements), genome-wide polymorphic markers, efficient genotyping platforms, high-density and high-resolution linkage maps, and transcriptome resources including non-coding transcripts. Genomic and genetic control of important performance and production traits, such as disease resistance, feed conversion efficiency, growth rate, processing yield, behaviour, reproductive characteristics, and tolerance to environmental stressors like low dissolved oxygen, high or low water temperature and salinity, must be understood. QTL need to be identified, validated across strains, lines and populations, and their mechanisms of control understood. Causal gene(s) need to be identified. Genetic and epigenetic regulation of important aquaculture traits need to be determined, and technologies for marker-assisted selection, causal gene/mutation-assisted selection, genome selection, and genome editing using CRISPR and other technologies must be developed, demonstrated with applicability, and application to aquaculture industries. Major progress has been made in aquaculture genomics for dozens of fish and shellfish species including the development of genetic linkage maps, physical maps, microarrays, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, transcriptome databases and various stages of genome reference sequences. This paper provides a general review of the current status, challenges and future research needs of aquaculture genomics, genetics, and breeding, with a focus on major aquaculture species in the United States: catfish, rainbow trout, Atlantic salmon, tilapia, striped bass, oysters, and shrimp. While the overall research priorities and the practical goals are similar across various aquaculture species, the current status in each species should dictate the next priority areas within the species. This paper is an output of the USDA Workshop for Aquaculture Genomics, Genetics, and Breeding held in late March 2016 in Auburn, Alabama, with participants from all parts of the United States.},

@article{Guillot2012,
abstract = {While flatfish in the wild exhibit a pronounced countershading of the dorso-ventral pigment pattern, malpigmentation is commonly observed in reared animals. In fish, the dorso-ventral pigment polarity is achieved because a melanization inhibition factor (MIF) inhibits melanoblast differentiation and encourages iridophore proliferation in the ventrum. A previous work of our group suggested that asip1 is the uncharacterized MIF concerned. In order to further support this hypothesis, we have characterized asip1 mRNAs in both turbot and sole and used deduced peptide alignments to analyze the evolutionary history of the agouti-family of peptides. The putative asip precursors have the characteristics of a secreted protein, displaying a putative hydrophobic signal. Processing of the potential signal peptide produces mature proteins that include an N-terminal region, a basic central domain with a high proportion of lysine residues as well as a proline-rich region that immediately precedes the C-terminal poly-cysteine domain. The expression of asip1 mRNA in the ventral area was significantly higher than in the dorsal region. Similarly, the expression of asip1 within the unpigmented patches in the dorsal skin of pseudoalbino fish was higher than in the pigmented dorsal regions but similar to those levels observed in the ventral skin. In addition, the injection/electroporation of asip1 capped mRNA in both species induced long term dorsal skin paling, suggesting the inhibition of the melanogenic pathways. The data suggest that fish asip1 is involved in the dorsal-ventral pigment patterning in adult fish, where it induces the regulatory asymmetry involved in precursor differentiation into mature chromatophore. Adult dorsal pseudoalbinism seems to be the consequence of the expression of normal developmental pathways in an inaccurate position that results in unbalanced asip1 production levels. This, in turn, generates a ventral-like differentiation environment in dorsal regions.},

We propose that the plasticity of the gut microbiota might be an essential factor determining phenomic plasticity of vertebrates, and that it might play a pivotal role when vertebrates acclimate and adapt to fast environmental variation. We contemplate some key questions and suggest methodological approaches and experimental designs that can be used to evaluate whether gut microorganisms provide a boost of plasticity to vertebrates' phenomes, thereby increasing their acclimation and adaptation capacity.},

Further studies estimated microsatellite DNA marker-based relationships using sibship reconstruction approaches. Color components of red and green in yellowish individuals were significantly higher than that of normal individuals. However, the blue component of yellowish individuals was significantly lower than that of normal individuals. Four microsatellite loci were used for sibship reconstruction. Results indicated that most yellowish individuals were generated predominantly by two half-sibs. Sibship reconstruction suggested that the yellowish individuals identified in a hatchery population of Japanese flounder may have arisen via genetic effects. Assessing the parentage of abnormal fish used in seed production, and the removal of parents generating abnormal fish, would represent a new strategy for retrospective selective breeding.},

Alongside preventing desiccation, chemical damage and hypothermia, this barrier protects the body from invading pathogens through a sophisticated innate immune response and co-adapted consortium of commensal microorganisms, collectively termed the microbiota. These microorganisms inhabit distinct biogeographical regions dictated by skin physiology. Thus, it follows that perturbations to normal skin homeostasis, as occurs with ageing, diabetes and skin disease, can cause microbial dysbiosis and increase infection risk. In this review, we discuss emerging concepts in skin microbiome research, highlighting pertinent links between skin ageing, the microbiome and cutaneous repair. Moreover, we address gaps in current knowledge and highlight key areas requiring further exploration.

The SS and AM Artemia were tested in three different combinations: (1) a 1:1 ratio continuously to day 60 (AM/SS); (2) a 1:1 ratio to day 41, then AM only (AM/SS-41); and (3) AM only to day 41, then a 1:1 ratio (AM-41). The fourth treatment comprised TOO/AM Artemia, which was fed continuously. At day 60 post first feeding, measurements were made of survival and growth rates, postmetamorphic characteristics (i.e. eye migration and pigment distribution), and lipid composition. The mean survival rates ranged from 65.1% to 84.5%. Specific growth rates varied from 7.64 to 8.13. The eye migration indices were between 2.3 and 2.6. These parameters did not differ significantly among treatments (P>0.05).

abstract = {In order to better understand the endocrine aberrations related to abnormal metamorphic pigmentation that appear in flounder larvae reared in tanks, this study examined the effects of continuous 24-h illumination (LL) through larval development on the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase-1 (th1), proopiomelanocortin (pomc), $\alpha$-melanophore-stimulating hormone ($\alpha$-MSH) and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), which are known to participate in the control of background adaptation of body color. We observed two conspicuous deviations in the endocrine system under LL when compared with natural light conditions (LD). First, LL severely suppressed th1 expression in the dopaminergic neurons in the anterior diencephalon, including the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Second, pomc and $\alpha$-MSH expression in the pars intermedia melanotrophs was enhanced by LL. Skin color was paler under LL than LD before metamorphic pigmentation, and abnormal metamorphic pigmentation occurred at a higher ratio in LL. We therefore hypothesize that continuous LL inhibited dopamine synthesis in the SCN, which resulted in up-regulation of pomc mRNA expression in the melanotrophs. In spite of the up-regulation of pomc in the melanotrophs, larval skin was adjusted to be pale by MCH which was not affected by LL. Accumulation of $\alpha$-MSH in the melanotrophs is caused by uncoupling of $\alpha$-MSH synthesis and secretion due to inhibitory role of MCH on $\alpha$-MSH secretion, which results in abnormal metamorphic pigmentation by affecting differentiation of adult-type melanophores. Our data demonstrate that continuous illumination at the post-embryonic stage has negative effects on the neuroendocrine system and pituitary in flounder. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Flatfish pigmentation is a complex process, affected by environmental factors including light, nutrients, and hormones. Of those, the thyroid hormone has been reported to increase the albinism rate of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine, and thiourea were introduced into P. olivaceus larvae from 16 to 57 days after hatching (DAH). By comparison of albinism rate, T3 treatment and control larvae of 42 DAH were chosen for mRNA and miRNA high-throughput sequencing analyses. A total of 337 miRNAs were identified via miRNA-seq, and 12 miRNAs exhibited significantly differential expression patterns in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (TPM > 10, fold change ≥ 1.5 or ≤ 0.67 and q ≤ 0.05). These differentially expressed miRNAs targeted 3658 putative genes, which further enriched to 10 GO terms (q < 0.05). RNA-seq identified 146 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in D42_T3 versus D42_Con (|log2 fold change| > 1 and q < 0.005), including pigmentation-related genes such as the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-3, pro-opiomelanocortin A, and melanotransferrin, and the growth-related gene somatotropin. These DEGs were significantly enriched to 15 GO terms and 8 KEGG pathways (q < 0.05), which included several sugar metabolic pathways (glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway). Integrated analysis revealed that 26 overlapping genes between DEGs and mRNAs were targeted by miRNAs. Furthermore, seven mRNA-miRNA pairs exhibited reversed regulation patterns. This provides important clues to understand the role of thyroid hormones in flatfish pigmentation.},

abstract = {Yeasts of the genus, Malassezia, formerly known as Pityrosporum, are lipophilic yeasts, which are a part of the normal skin flora (microbiome). Malassezia colonize the human skin after birth and must therefore, as commensals, be normally tolerated by the human immune system. The Malassezia yeasts also have a pathogenic potential where they can, under appropriate conditions, invade the stratum corneum and interact with the host immune system, both directly but also through chemical mediators. The species distribution on the skin and the pathogenetic potential of the yeast varies between different Malassezia related diseases such as head and neck dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, pityriasis versicolor, and Malassezia folliculitis. The diagnostic methods used to confirm the presence of Malassezia yeasts include direct microcopy, culture based methods (often a combination of morphological features of the isolate combined with biochemical test), molecular based methods such as Polymerase Chain Reaction techniques, and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization—Time Of Flight mass spectrometry and the chemical imprint method Raman spectroscopy. Skin diseases caused by Malassezia are usually treated with antifungal therapy and if there are associated inflammatory skin mechanisms this is often supplemented by anti-inflammatory therapy. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of Malassezia related skin disease, diagnostic methods and treatment options.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of dietary docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3, DHA) on growth, survival, pigmentation and fatty acid composition of Senegal sole larvae using a dose-response design. From 3 to 35 days post-hatch (dph), larvae were fed live food (rotifers from 3 to 9 dph, Artemia nauplii from 5 to 35 dph) that had been enriched using one of four experimental emulsions containing four graduated concentrations of DHA and constant arachidonic acid (20:4n-6, ARA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3, EPA). Final proportions of DHA in the enriched Artemia nauplii were described as 'nil' (DHA-N, 0.0% total fatty acids, TFA), 'low' (DHA-L, 4.4% TFA), 'medium' (DHA-M, 7.7% TFA) or 'high' (DHA-H, 14.7% TFA). Significant differences among dietary treatments in larval length occurred at 20, 30 and 36 dph, and in dry weight at 20 and 30 dph, although there was no significant relationship between dietary DHA and growth. The stage of eye migration at 20 dph was significantly affected by dietary levels of DHA. No significant differences in survival were obtained. Tissue fatty acid concentrations reflected the corresponding dietary composition. Fish fed DHA-M and -H enriched nauplii tended to accumulate less lipid, mainly oleic acid (OA), in the carcass that might have caused the lower growth in length observed in DHA-H fish. We hypothesise that negligible amounts of dietary DHA required for normal development in Senegal sole larvae relate to a predominance of EPA rather than DHA in the benthic fauna which this flatfish consumes in the wild post-settlement. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The mechanisms for asymmetric skin color formation in the Japanese flounder are studied with particular concerns to causes for pigment disorder (hypomelanosis) occurring under hatchery conditions. For an analysis of normal pigmentation, fish were raised with wild zooplanktons in an indoor hatchery, whilst for hypomelanosis, they were raised with Brazilian Artemia nauplii, a diet used in the hatcheries. Morphological observations, counting of melanophores, histochemical assay of DOPA‐positive immature cells (melanoblasts), and radiometric estimation of tyrosinase activities in skins of developing larvae and juveniles indicate that 1) the structural plan for pigmentation in this species is bilaterally symmetric until metamorphosis, utilizing large‐sized melanophores (hence larval melanophores) as main vehicles, and 2) an asymmetric coloration characteristic to metamorphosed juveniles is formed by an intensive development of smaller‐sized melanophores (hence adult‐type melanophores) appearing selectively in the ocular side at the later stages of metamorphosis and by an absence of it in the blind. These findings apparently indicate that 1) two types of melanophores occur in this species which differ with respect to morphological properties and developmental fate, and 2) selective differentiation of adult type melanophores in the ocular side of the body at or after metamorphosis is primarily responsible for an asymmetric coloration of its adult form. The similar assays on the fish fed with Artemia nauplii indicate that defective development of adult‐type melanophores results in hypomelanosis in their ocular‐sided skins, yielding a pigmentary pattern seen in the blind side of the metamorphosed juveniles with normal pigmentation. Thus, it is likely that some nutritional factor(s) present or deficient in these Artemia nauplii interfere with the development of adult‐type melanophores, possibly through modified tissue environment.

abstract = {The effect of a wild zooplankton supply on the appearance of albinism in juvenile flounder P. olivaceus was studied by two rearing experiments. Flounder larvae were initially reared with only rotifer Brachionus plicatilis and then given wild zooplankton and rotifer or only wild zooplankton, from 5.50-5.57 mm TL to complete metamorphosis. These were compared with those given Brazilian Artemia salina nauplii and rotifer during the same stage. Larvae given wild zooplankton showed poorer growth and lower survival rate than those given Artemia. However the frequency occurrence of albinism in the former was very much lower (0.1 -1.8%) than in the latter (97.2-100.0%). When flounder larvae were given wild zooplankton and rotifer, they took 40.0-76.3% rotifer in number during pelagic stage, These results suggested the possibility of preventing albinism through the improvement of cultured foods during early life stage. {\textcopyright} 1985, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

abstract = {In the aquaculture of the Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus, hypermelanosis, a malpigmentation condition in which the scales of a significant area on the blind side express the characteristics of those on the ocular side, remains a major concern. Since introducing sand into the rearing tank effectively suppresses hypermelanosis, the inhibitory effects of various characteristics of the surface of the tank floor were investigated. Although an inhibitory effect was observed in both tanks with a sand-image floor and a sand-pasted floor, the strongest effect was found in tanks with a dimpled floor. In addition, covering the inner surface of the tank with net also inhibited hypermelanosis. Using a commercially available corrugated plate, the inhibition of hypermelanosis was confirmed with a noted increase in this effect when combined with light coloration. Juveniles tended to situate themselves in the valley portions of the corrugated plate, suggesting that floor contact with the blind side may contribute to hypermelanosis inhibition. Further observations on the floor contact area with various floor configurations suggested that hypermelanosis is locally suppressed in the areas with floor contact. Therefore, suppression by an undulated (both dimpled and corrugated) floor is likely due to an increase in floor contact area with the blind side.},

abstract = {For the analysis of microbial community structure based on 16S rDNA sequence diversity, sensitive and robust PCR amplification of 16S rDNA is a critical step. To obtain accurate microbial composition data, PCR amplification must be free of bias; however, amplifying all 16S rDNA species with equal efficiency from a sample containing a large variety of microorganisms remains challenging. Here, we designed a universal primer based on the V3-V4 hypervariable region of prokaryotic 16S rDNA for the simultaneous detection of Bacteria and Archaea in fecal samples from crossbred pigs (Landrace×Large white×Duroc) using an Illumina MiSeq next-generation sequencer. In-silico analysis showed that the newly designed universal prokaryotic primers matched approximately 98.0% of Bacteria and 94.6% of Archaea rRNA gene sequences in the Ribosomal Database Project database. For each sequencing reaction performed with the prokaryotic universal primer, an average of 69,330 (±20,482) reads were obtained, of which archaeal rRNA genes comprised approximately 1.2% to 3.2% of all prokaryotic reads. In addition, the detection frequency of Bacteria belonging to the phylum Verrucomicrobia, including members of the classes Verrucomicrobiae and Opitutae, was higher in the NGS analysis using the prokaryotic universal primer than that performed with the bacterial universal primer. Importantly, this new prokaryotic universal primer set had markedly lower bias than that of most previously designed universal primers. Our findings demonstrate that the prokaryotic universal primer set designed in the present study will permit the simultaneous detection of Bacteria and Archaea, and will therefore allow for a more comprehensive understanding of microbial community structures in environmental samples.},

abstract = {In farmed flatfish, such as common sole, color disturbances are common. Dyschromia is a general term that includes the color defects on the blind and ocular sides of the fish. The purpose was to examine the difference in gene expression between normal pigmented and juveniles who present ambicoloration. The analysis was carried out with next-generation sequencing techniques and de novo assembly of the transcriptome. Transcripts that showed significant differences (FDR < 0.05) in the expression between the two groups, were related to those of zebrafish (Danio rerio), functionally identified, and classified into categories of the gene ontology. The results revealed that ambicolorated juveniles exhibit a divergent function, mainly of the central nervous system at the synaptic level, as well as the ionic channels. The close association of chromophore cells with the growth of nerve cells and the nervous system was recorded. The pathway, glutamate binding–activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors–long-term stimulation of postsynaptic potential–LTP (long term potentiation)– plasticity of synapses, appears to be affected. In addition, the development of synapses also seems to be affected by the interaction of the LGI (leucine-rich glioma inactivated) protein family with the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) ones.},

abstract = {Southern flounder skin pigmentation is a critical phenotypic characteristic for this species' survival in the natural environment. Normal pigmentation allows rapid changes of color for concealment to capture prey and UV light protection. In contrast, highly visible hypopigmented pseudo-albinos exhibit a compromised immune system and are vulnerable to predation, sensitive to UV exposure, and likely have poor survival in the wild. Skin and brain tissue samples from normally pigmented and hypopigmented individuals were analyzed with next-generation RNA sequencing. A total of 1,589,613 transcripts were used to identify 952,825 genes to assemble a de novo transcriptome, with 99.43% of genes mapped to the assembly. Differential gene expression and gene enrichment analysis of contrasting tissues and phenotypes revealed that pseudo-albino individuals appeared more susceptible to environmental stress, UV light exposure, hypoxia, and osmotic stress. The pseudo-albinos' restricted immune response showed upregulated genes linked to cancer development, signaling and response, skin tissue formation, regeneration, and healing. The data indicate that a modified skin collagen structure likely affects melanocyte differentiation and distribution, generating the pseudo-albino phenotype. In addition, the comparison of the brain transcriptome revealed changes in myelination and melanocyte stem cell activity, which may indicate modified brain function, reduced melanocyte migration, and impaired vision.},

Fish skin pigmentation is one of the most important quality criteria dictating the market value of both aquaculture and ornamental species because it serves as an external signal to infer its welfare and the culture conditions used. For that reason, several studies have been conducted aiming to understand the mechanisms underlying fish pigmentation as well as the influence exerted by rearing conditions.

abstract = {Barfin flounder larvae exhibit unique black coloration, as well as left-right asymmetry in juvenile stage as in other flatfish. In this study, we first assessed the changes in melanophores with development and then investigated their responsiveness to melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) during metamorphosis. Larval-type melanophores appeared on both sides of the body before metamorphosis, whereas adult-type melanophores appeared only on the ocular side after metamorphosis. Even in the individuals of this species displaying black coloration, the density of larval-type melanophores was similar to that in transparent larvae of other species. However, unlike in transparent larvae, larval-type melanophores completely dispersed in the black larvae of this species. Therefore, the black coloration during larval stages was mainly due to dispersion, and not the density, of larval-type melanophores. In vitro MCH treatment revealed, for the first time, the responsiveness of melanophores in larval stages. On the ocular side, larval-type melanophores aggregated against MCH during larval stages, while, in the larvae at later metamorphic stages and in juveniles, larval-type melanophores did not aggregate, although aggregation of adult-type melanophores was noted. In contrast, on the blind side, the responsiveness of larval-type melanophores to MCH was consistently present from larval to juvenile stages. The metamorphic transition of MCH responsiveness from larval- to adult-type melanophores only on the ocular side suggests the larval (therefore, immature) nature of the blind side skin. We propose that the inhibited development, and thus the retention of the larval-type skin leads to the formation of the blind side characteristics and is the central mechanism for the flatfish asymmetry. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Hypermelanosis of the blind side of Japanese flounder frequently occurs in post-metamorphic juveniles reared in hatcheries. Due to the morphological similarity between darkened blind-side skin and normal ocular-side skin, hypermelanosis is regarded as a transition from normal blind-side skin to that of the ocular side. Hypermelanosis appears only in rearing tanks without sand on the bottom, and its incidence tends to increase under stressful conditions; however, the specific mechanisms responsible for its occurrence have not been identified to date. In teleosts, the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal axis (HPI axis) is activated under stress, which then accelerates cortisol secretion. Therefore, in this study, we orally administered cortisol to Japanese flounder to examine its effect on hypermelanosis. The results of our study indicated that cortisol promoted hypermelanosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the effect of cortisol was canceled out in juveniles reared in tanks with bottom sand, suggesting that the well-documented inhibitory effect of bottom sand is stronger than the stimulatory effect of cortisol (i.e., stress) on hypermelanosis. However, administration of the cortisol antagonist RU486 failed to inhibit hypermelanosis, suggesting the contribution of other stimulatory factors to this process. Therefore, our findings strongly suggest that stress-induced cortisol release has the adverse effect of promoting hypermelanosis in juvenile flounders reared without bottom sand.},

Additional changes related to eye migration include asymmetrical pigmentation, and a behavioral shift from larvae that exhibit upright, open-water swimming to juveniles and adults that lie on the ocean floor, eye side up. However, the morphology of these juveniles has been quite plastic in recent years, a phenomenon which is thought to be related to a diverse suite of semi-intensive and intensive larviculture methods. The cause of morphological abnormalities in the farmed flatfish is poorly understood. In the present study, we observe the features of morphological specificity and abnormality of immature fish (mean total length 23 cm) and survey the occurrence frequency of the specificity and abnormality of juvenile (mean total length 6.70 cm) in artificial culture facility. We find 2 types of abnormality (e.g., albino in ocular side and hypermelanosis in blind side) and 1 type of specificity (e.g., lateral polymorphism). These considerably differ from normal individuals (has sinistral eye and pigmented on only one side) by several characteristics (dextral eye, ocular side albinism, blind side hypermelanosis). The incidences of albinism, hypermelanosis, and body reversal are 10.1 ± 2.56%, 91.7 ± 1.7%, and 13.1 ± 1.1%, respectively. These suggest that these morphometric and morphological differences occur more in artificial environment during and just after metamorphosis. {\textcopyright} The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.},

abstract = {The dispersal and optimum release size of Japanese flounder stocked in Ishikari Bay, the most northern area where fry was stocked, were examined by tagging and marking experiments and market surveys of commercial landings. In Ishikari Bay, 17,055 tagged flounder (mean TL = 13 cm) were released in September 1988, and 59,600 (mean TL = 8 cm) and 72,900 (mean TL = 6 cm) fin-clipped flounder were stocked between July and August 1989. Hatchery-reared flounder have an abnormal white and black pigmentation on the anocular side, which easily distinguishes them from wild flounder. The recovery rate of a released group of flounder with an average length of 8 cm (8.2%) was 2.4 times that of a group with an average length of 6 cm (3.2%). In the tagging experiment, a total of 330 (1.9%) recoveries were recorded between October 1988 and November 1991. The tagging experiment showed that the distribution of the stocked flounder extended southward to the Tsushima Current; no fish were recaptured to the north of the release site. The numbers of stocked flounder in the landings decreased with increasing distance from the release area and 75% of recaptured flounder were caught within Ishikari Bay. The tagging experiment also showed that 68% of the fish which recruited to the fishery at ≤25 cm TL were captured inside Ishikari Bay.},

abstract = {The microbiome plays an important role in lipid metabolism but how the introduction of probiotic communities affects host lipid metabolism is poorly understood. Using a multidisciplinary approach we addressed this knowledge gap using the zebrafish model by coupling high-throughput sequencing with biochemical, molecular and morphological analysis to evaluate the changes in the intestine. Analysis of bacterial 16S libraries revealed that Lactobacillus rhamnosus was able to modulate the gut microbiome of zebrafish larvae, elevating the abundance of Firmicutes sequences and reducing the abundance of Actinobacteria. The gut microbiome changes modulated host lipid processing by inducing transcriptional down-regulation of genes involved in cholesterol and triglycerides metabolism (fit2, agpat4, dgat2, mgll, hnf4$\alpha$, scap and cck) concomitantly decreasing total body cholesterol and triglyceride content and increasing fatty acid levels. L. rhamnosus treatment also increased microvilli and enterocyte lengths and decreased lipid droplet size in the intestinal epithelium. These changes resulted in elevated zebrafish larval growth. This integrated system investigation demonstrates probiotic modulation of the gut microbiome, highlights a novel gene network involved in lipid metabolism, provides an insight into how the microbiome regulates molecules involved in lipid metabolism and reveals a new potential role for L. rhamnosus in the treatment of lipid disorders.},

abstract = {Background: Vitiligo, a depigmenting autoimmune skin disease characterized by melanocyte dysfunction or death, is known to be associated with an imbalance in gut microbiota. Oxidative stress plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. However, the complex promising interaction between abnormal accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the skin and gut microbiota has remained unclear. Results: Here, we compared transcriptome data of vitiligo lesions and normal skin and identified a high expression of oxidative stress-related genes in vitiligo lesions. We also established a vitiligo mouse model and found that the presence of gut microbiota influenced the expression of ROS-related genes. Depletion of gut microbiota reduced abnormal ROS accumulation and mitochondrial abnormalities in melanocytes, significantly improving depigmentation. Our findings from manipulating gut microbiota through cohousing, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), and probiotic supplementation showed that transferring gut microbiota from mice with severe vitiligo-like phenotypes exacerbated skin depigmentation while probiotics inhibited its progression. Targeted metabolomics of fecal, serum, and skin tissues revealed gut microbiota-dependent accumulation of hippuric acid, mediating excessive ROS in the skin. Elevated serum hippuric acid levels were also confirmed in vitiligo patients. Additionally, a microbiota-dependent increase in intestinal permeability in vitiligo mice mediated elevated hippuric acid levels, and we found that hippuric acid could directly bind to ROS-related proteins (NOS2 and MAPK14). Conclusions: Our results suggested the important role of gut microbiota in regulating vitiligo phenotypes and oxidative stress. We identified hippuric acid, a gut microbiota-host co-metabolite, as a critical mediator of oxidative stress in vitiligo skin and its binding targets (NOS2 and MAPK14), resulting in oxidative stress. Validation in a small human cohort suggested that hippuric acid could serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for vitiligo. These findings provided new insights into how gut microbiota regulates skin oxidative stress in vitiligo and suggested potential treatment strategies for the disease. 8-83LeDu4YFos1a_9ZYpcdVideo Abstract.},

abstract = {The California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) is a good candidate for aquaculture due to its good growth, survival and high commercial value. Several farms in the Western coast of North America are currently evaluating the potential of this species under commercial conditions. However, one of the main problems in the production of juveniles for commercial purposes is the high percentage of malpigmented fish obtained after metamorphosis (up to 80%). This problem seems to be related, among other things, to nutritional deficiencies during the larval period, in particular to the quantities and proportions of highly unsaturated fatty acids (HUFAs) in the diet. As a first approach to reduce malpigmentation, improve growth and determine the requirement for DHA in California halibut late larvae, we evaluated the effect of four levels of dietary DHA (0, 1, 2, and 4% of total fatty acids in the diet) on growth, survival, weaning success and pigmentation. DHA was administered to the larvae through enriched Artemia metanauplii. Larvae standard length and wet weight were taken during the initial stage of Artemia metanauplii supplementation (18 days post hatch, dph); at the beginning of the weaning period (50 dph); and at the end of the experiment (75 dph). We quantified the amounts of total fatty acids in 18 and 50 dph larvae. No significant differences on growth, survival and pigmentation as a result of increasing dietary DHA levels were found in 50 dph recently settled juveniles. However, larvae fed the highest DHA level resulted in the highest growth and survival at the end of the experiment (75 dph). Additionally, highest weaning success was achieved with this treatment. Significantly higher numbers of normally pigmented fish (ca., 33%) were obtained with the highest DHA level at 75 dph compared to the low DHA levels (0 and 5%). However, since this treatment resulted in the highest survival, part of the population had abnormal pigmentation (ca., 30% of the population). Based on a second order polynomial regression, the recommended DHA level in the diet for pre-metamorphic larvae to attain adequate growth and survival as estimated here for recently settled California halibut at 50 dph was 1.21% DHA of total fatty acids (TFA). However, for post-metamorphosis fish (75 dph) highest pigmentation rates, growth and survival are obtained with 2.40% DHA of TFA in the diet during the Artemia feeding period. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

To understand the mechanism of blind-side hypermelanosis in flatfishes, we examined when the malpigmentation initially occurred, and studied how the symptoms proceeded during early development of the starry flounder, Platichthys stellatus. To assess quantitative pattern changes of blind-side skin, we observed morphological development of the whole body from 22 (total length [TL] 10.0±0.2 mm and body weight [BW] 8.8±0.57 mg) to 110 days (TL 23.4±0.7 mm, BW 193.6±23.3 mg) after hatching (DAH), and also examined the malpigmented area rate of blind-side skin and the malpigmented fish ratios. The experimental animals were reared in fiberglass-reinforced plastic (FRP) tanks in water at a temperature of 18.9±1.9°C and salinity of 32.6±0.6 psu and were fed with rotifer and Artemia nauplii from 22 to 48 DAH, and with A. nauplii and commercial feed from 49 to 110 DAH. As results, the first staining patch seen by the naked eye was observed around the area between the anus and pelvic fin or caudal edge of the trunk at 80 DAH (TL 20.6±0.5 mm, BW 112.5±8.8 mg). The pigmented area and the pigmented fish ratios were significantly increased from 80 to 110 DAH. These results indicated that malpigmentation on the blind side of starry flounder was initially observed at about 2 cm in length and 100 mg in weight, and the pigmented domain on the blind-side skin was continually broadened by the differentiation of pigmented cells (melanophores and xanthophores) with growth.},

abstract = {Blind-side hypermelanosis has emerged as a major concern in flatfish aquaculture worldwide, including tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) in China. The causative gene and the molecular basis are still unclear. In this study, comparative transcriptome analyses were performed using different skin tissues of tongue sole: ocular-side normal (pigmented) skin, blind-side normal (non-pigmented) skin and blind-side hypermelanotic (pigmented) skin. Finally, 60 key hypermelanosis-related genes were mined, providing potential candidate gene resources involved in blind-side hypermelanosis. These genes were selected based on the log2(FoldChange) and false discovery rate (FDR) values (with corresponding P-Values < 0.05), and they were verified in other species to assess if they were directly or indirectly related to melanogenesis. The protein-protein interaction network of these 60 genes and the relationship between tyr and other key hypermelanosis-related genes were illustrated. The qRT-PCR validation of 16 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that the data of qRT-PCR were consistent with those of RNA-seq. Further analyses revealed that the selected DEGs were significantly overrepresented in several pigment metabolic processes and in the melanogenesis pathway. Our results may imply that blind-side hypermelanosis is a pattern of environmental regulation of gene expression and adaptation in flatfish. Membrane transport proteins (such as OCA2 and SLC45A2) may serve as a “switch” for melanogenesis in tongue sole. Overall, this study provided novel insights into the molecular mechanism of hypermelanosis in flatfish species and will facilitate future selective breeding of tongue sole for this market-favoured trait in aquaculture.},

Clonal analysis indicates that these progenitors remain multipotent and plastic beyond embryogenesis well into metamorphosis, when the adult color pattern develops. Pigment cells share a lineage with neuronal cells of the peripheral nervous system; progenitors propagate along the spinal nerves. The proliferation of pigment cells is regulated by competitive interactions among cells of the same type. An even spacing involves collective migration and contact inhibition of locomotion of the three cell types distributed in superimposed monolayers in the skin. This mode of coloring the skin is probably common to fish, whereas different patterns emerge by species specific cell interactions among the different pigment cell types. These interactions are mediated by channels involved in direct cell contact between the pigment cells, as well as unknown cues provided by the tissue environment.},

abstract = {How fish larvae are protected frominfection before the maturation of adaptive immunity, a process which may take up to several weeks in most species, has long been a matter of speculation. Using a germ-free model, we show that colonization by commensals in newly hatched zebrafish primes neutrophils and induces several genes encoding proinflammatory and antiviral mediators, increasing the resistance of larvae to viral infection. Commensal microbe recognition was found to be mediated mainly through a TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway, and professional phagocytes were identified as the source of these immunemediators. However, the induction of proinflammatory and antiviral genes, but not of antimicrobial effector genes, also required the covalent modification of histone H3 at gene promoters. Interestingly, chromatin modifications were not altered by commensal microbes or hatching. Taken together, our results demonstrate that gene-specific chromatin modifications are associated with the protection of zebrafish larvae against infectious agents before adaptive immunity has developed and prevent pathologies associated with excessive inflammation during development.},

The fish immunity can sense and shape the intestinal microbiota and maintain the intestinal homeostasis. In the meantime, the intestinal commensal microbes regulate the fish immunity, control the extravagant proliferation of pathogenic microorganisms, and ensure the intestinal health of the host. This review summarizes developments and progress on the known interactions between host immunity and intestinal microorganisms in fish, focusing on the recent advances in zebrafish (Danio rerio) showing the host immunity senses and shapes intestinal microbiota, and intestinal microorganisms tune host immunity.

abstract = {The objectives of the present study are to elucidate the effects of rearing temperatures on early larval development and the occurrence of metamorphosis-related morphological abnormalities in hatchery-reared brown sole Pseudopleuronectes herzensteini. Newly hatched larvae were reared through metamorphosis at different temperatures (6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24°C). Growth and development of larvae were accelerated concomitant with higher temperatures. Metamorphosed juveniles were classified into four morphological categories as normal, pseudoalbinism (two types), and ambicoloration, in combination with body color (pigmentation) and eye location. Incidence of normal morphology was lowest (11-24%) and that of pseudoalbinism was highest (74-83%) at 12°C. The highest incidence of normal morphology (51-73%) was obtained at 21°C. Although occurrence of ambicoloration was very low in all temperature regimes (0-10%), it increased slightly with increasing temperatures. Results of the present study strongly suggested that rearing temperature during the larval period affected the appearance of normal fish because of the different larval growth and development. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Fish body color changes play vital roles in adapting to ecological light environment and influencing market value. However, the initial mechanisms governing the changes remain unknown. Here, we scrutinized the impact of light spectrum on turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) body coloration, exposing them to red, blue, and full light spectra from embryo to 90 days post hatch. Transcriptome and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses were employed to elucidate underlying biological processes. The results showed that red light induced dimorphism in turbot juvenile skin pigmentation: some exhibited black coloration (Red_Black_Surface, R_B_S), while others displayed lighter skin (Red_White_Bottom, R_W_B), with red light leading to reduced skin lightness (L*) and body weight, particularly in R_B_S group. Transcriptomic and qRT-PCR analyses showcased upregulated gene expressions related to melanin synthesis in R_B_S individuals, notably tyrosinase (tyr), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (tyrp1), and dopachrome tautomerase (dct), alongside solute carrier family 24 member 5 (slc24a5) and oculocutaneous albinism type II (oca2) as pivotal regulators. Nervous system emerged as a critical mediator in spectral environment-driven color regulation. N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, and calcium signaling pathway emerged as pivotal links intertwining spectral conditions, neural signal transduction, and color regulation. The individual differences in NMDA glutamate receptor expression and subsequent neural excitability seemed responsible for dichromatic body coloration in red light-expose juveniles. This study provides new insights into the comprehending of fish adaptation to environment and methods for fish body color regulation and could potentially help enhance the economic benefit of fish farming industry.},

abstract = {Fish deformities are detrimental to aquaculture and conservation initiatives; it is also an ethical problem and causes substantial financial losses to the aquaculture industry. The exact mechanism of deformities is still a mystery. Several factors cause deformities in fish; it seems that the deformations are inevitable but can be minimised by adopting good aquaculture practices such as proper broodstock husbandry, standard breeding and larval rearing protocol, management of water quality parameters, and providing nutritionally balanced feed, especially to the broodstock and developing larvae. In addition, it can be minimised by early detection of deformities, especially at the embryonic and larval stages. Monitoring of stocking materials should be an essential part of responsible aquaculture and conservation programmes; stocking materials should be free from any types of deformities as it affects not only aquaculture production, profitability and success of conservation programmes but also the reoccurrence of deformities in nature. The mechanism behind deformities and the development of low-cost, robust methods/tools for detecting deformities in fish remain a challenge. Still, the opportunity exists to develop a robust marker that can predict deformities even at early embryonic and larval stages.},

abstract = {After metamorphosis, both eyes of the Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus are located on its left side, with only the ocular side becoming pigmented. Staining, or hypermelanosis, occurs on the blind side at 2–3 months after metamorphosis, thereby lowering the market price of the fish. To understand the pigmentation expansion process, we performed scale transplantation between the blind and ocular sides of an individual. About 40 % of transplanted scales were successfully engrafted, regardless of donor or recipient site. When blind-side scales were transplanted to the ocular side, they became pigmented after 2 weeks, while no change was observed when the scales were transplanted to the blind side. Ocular-side scales did not lose pigment, regardless of the recipient site. However, after removal of transplanted ocular-side scales, pigmented scales regenerated after 3 weeks, even at blind-side sites. Identical results were obtained when the stained area on the blind side was used as the recipient location. When an ocular-side scale with skin tissue was inserted under blind-side scales, the scales immediately above the transplanted area became pigmented, whereas ocular-side scales stripped of tissue did not induce pigmentation. These results strongly suggest the presence of an ocular-side characteristic inducer in pigmented scale tissues.},

abstract = {The microbiome plays an important role in a wide variety of skin disorders. Not only is the skin microbiome altered, but also surprisingly many skin diseases are accompanied by an altered gut microbiome. The microbiome is a key regulator for the immune system, as it aims to maintain homeostasis by communicating with tissues and organs in a bidirectional manner. Hence, dysbiosis in the skin and/or gut microbiome is associated with an altered immune response, promoting the development of skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, acne vulgaris, dandruff, and even skin cancer. Here, we focus on the associations between the microbiome, diet, metabolites, and immune responses in skin pathologies. This review describes an exhaustive list of common skin conditions with associated dysbiosis in the skin microbiome as well as the current body of evidence on gut microbiome dysbiosis, dietary links, and their interplay with skin conditions. An enhanced understanding of the local skin and gut microbiome including the underlying mechanisms is necessary to shed light on the microbial involvement in human skin diseases and to develop new therapeutic approaches.},

Daily feed intake (DFI), feed conversion efficiency (FE), growth rate, condition factors, and survival rate were calculated at the end of the experiment. Although the FE was higher in the high-density compared to the control, the two density groups showed similar feed intakes, growth, and survival. The ratio of staining area as well as the ratio of ambicolored fish significantly were significantly higher in the high-density group than in the control from days 30 to 60, but significantly increased and evened out by the end of the experiment (P<0.05). In conclusion, we determined that rearing density is not the main cause of the blind-side hypermelanosis, but found that increasing the rearing density can accelerate the ambicoloration in olive flounders. {\textcopyright} The Korean Society of Fisheries and Aquatic Science.},

In this study, these morphological abnormalities of six pleuronectid species- barfin flounder Verasper moseri, slime flounder Microstomus achne, stone flounder Platichthys bicoloratus, starry flounder Pl. stellatus, cresthead flounder Pseudopleuronectes schrenki, and marbled sole Ps. yokohamae-were successfully classified into four morphological types [normal, two types of pseudoalbinism (normal-eye position or top-eye position), and ambicoloration], following the same classification scheme proposed for other two pleuronectids. Based on our results, the characteristics of each morphological type are quite similar among species. It is confirmed that the normal type has the same ocular side and blind side characteristics as those of wild fish, not only in eye position and body coloration, but also in scales or dentition. The pseudoalbino types have the blind side characteristics of wild fish on both sides, with top-eye type in all characteristics, and normal-eye type in all other characteristics other than eye position. The ambicoloration type has all the ocular side characteristics of wild fish on both sides. Therefore, the pseudoalbinism and ambicoloration of hatchery-reared juveniles of pleuronectid species can be considered malformations of asymmetrical formation. Since this process normally occurs during metamorphosis, the term "metamorphosis-related malformation" is proposed for the abnormal formation of juveniles in pleuronectid species. {\textcopyright} The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science 2011.},

The objective of this paper is to analyse the economic performance of turbot companies in the EU between 2009 and 2020. In this way, biological, environmental, technological, political and social factors will be interrelated with the economic-financial performance of the sector in order to reach a holistic understanding of this industry. The novelty of this paper lies in the fact that it is the first to analyse the profitability of the 22 turbot companies, aggregated by size and location, in the EU. The results show that the countries that have achieved success in the production of this species, and whose companies are still active today, are those in which several favourable circumstances converge. Among the most important factors are the location of the plants in the natural distribution area of turbot, an adequate institutional climate, and the financial and technological capacity of the companies.},

abstract = {In farmed flatfish, such as common sole, color disturbances are common. Dyschromia is a general term that includes the color defects on the blind and ocular sides of the fish. The purpose was to examine the difference in gene expression between normal pigmented and juveniles who present ambicoloration. The analysis was carried out with next-generation sequencing techniques and de novo assembly of the transcriptome. Transcripts that showed significant differences (FDR < 0.05) in the expression between the two groups, were related to those of zebrafish (Danio rerio), functionally identified, and classified into categories of the gene ontology. The results revealed that ambicolorated juveniles exhibit a divergent function, mainly of the central nervous system at the synaptic level, as well as the ionic channels. The close association of chromophore cells with the growth of nerve cells and the nervous system was recorded. The pathway, glutamate binding–activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors–long-term stimulation of postsynaptic potential–LTP (long term potentiation)– plasticity of synapses, appears to be affected. In addition, the development of synapses also seems to be affected by the interaction of the LGI (leucine-rich glioma inactivated) protein family with the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) ones.},

abstract = {Pleuronectiformes, an order known as flatfishes, is important in mariculture worldwide with the unique characteristic of body asymmetry, and thus has value in scientific research. Also, as an economically important species, flatfishes have great developing potential for industrial aquaculture. Their rapid growth, rich nutrition, delicious taste, and high-quality protein are accepted and favoured by consumers all over the world. Due to large-scale breeding and expanding production, however, different degrees of abnormal body colour flatfishes have emerged, which seriously affect commercial value of the fish, even reducing it by half; therefore, relevant research has been carried out. This article reviews how environmental factors affect body colour abnormalities and possible genetic mechanism of abnormal body colouration of flatfishes, summarizes the hypotheses of the mechanism of body colour asymmetry, and proposes the latest improvement measures obtained at the genomic screening level to prevent the occurrence of abnormal body colour. This review suggests the molecular mechanism of abnormal asymmetric distribution of body colour, suggests measures for avoiding malpigmentation in flatfishes, and provides a constructive theoretical reference for healthy development of the flatfish breeding industry.},

abstract = {The influence of stocking density and food on hypermelanosis on the blind body side was investigated at the final phase of larval period in Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus. Four stocking densities, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 30,000 fish/m3 and two types of food, commercially produced artificial diet and Artemia nauplii, were tested. 27 days-old larvae (11.5mm in total length) accommodated in the 100l experimental tanks were reared under the above density and food conditions until age 42 days (about 20 mm TL). Pigmentations on the blind and ocular body sides of harvested juveniles were classified into 4 types of coloration. Higher stocking density and the artificial diet reduced the occurrence of normally colored fish (% NC) on the blind side. Stocking densities appeared to have no effect on % NC on the ocular side, while feeding of Artemia nauplii resulted in a lower % NC. These results suggest that current methods of mass-production of seedling should be improved to prevent hypermelanosis of the blind body side in Japanese flounder. {\textcopyright} 1994, The Japanese Society of Fisheries Science.

Individual's health, age and gender determine the type and the density of skin flora.Methods: A 1 cm2 of the skin on the sternum was rubbed with sterile cotton swab socked in 0.9% normal saline and plated on blood agar. This was cultured at 35°C. The bacteria were identified by culturing on MacConkey agar, coagulase test, catalase test and gram staining. Swabs were obtained from 66 individuals affected by albinism and 31 individuals with normal skin pigmentation. Those with normal skin were either relatives or staying with the individuals affected by albinism who were recruited for the study.Results: The mean age of the 97 recruited individuals was 30.6 (SD ± 14.9) years. The mean of the colony forming units was 1580.5 per cm2. Those affected by albinism had a significantly higher mean colony forming units (1680 CFU per cm2) as compared with 453.5 CFU per cm2 in those with normally pigmented skin (p = 0.023). The skin type and the severity of sun- damaged skin was significantly associated with a higher number of colony forming units (p = 0.038).Conclusion: Individuals affected by albinism have a higher number of colony forming units which is associated with sun- damaged skin. {\textcopyright} 2012 Kiprono et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {To identify exogenous and endogenous factors that directly affect hypermelanosis on the blind side of the olive flounder, Paralichthys olivaceus, we examined the potential relationships between blind-side hypermelanosis and three environmental factors (density, background color, and burrowing substratum) and four endocrine genes (prepro-melanin concentrating hormone [pMCH] and prepro-proopiomelanocortins [POMC]-I, II, and III) involved in physiological color change, using juveniles reared at high density in an artificial facility. We recorded the ratios of pigmented blind-side area and ambicolored fish among experimental groups, and compared pMCH and POMC mRNA activities between ordinary and hypermelanic groups. The results indicated that the density and the background color were not critical factors for blind-side hypermelanosis; however, these unnatural conditions (high density and dark background) accelerated the rate of hyperpigmentation. In addition, the presence of burrowing substratum on the bottom of the tank was effective for preventing blind-side hypermelanosis in developing olive flounders. In addition, expression of MCH mRNA was significantly lower in hypermelanic fish than in ordinary fish, but the levels of two POMC (POMC-I and II) mRNAs were higher in hypermelanic fish than in ordinary fish, suggesting that MCH inhibits blind-side hypermelanosis, but POMCs encourage malpigmentation. In conclusion, rearing density and background color are minor causes of the development of blind-side hypermelanosis in olive flounders, but the absence of a burrowing substratum, MCH inactivation, and activation of POMCs (I and II) are main factors involved in the development of hypermelanosis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Atlantic halibut juveniles, which have been fed Artemia during larval development, frequently demonstrate malpigmentation and impaired eye migration. This is in contrast to the high percentage of normally developed larvae fed copepods, reared under similar conditions. Nutrition is therefore an important component influencing larval development. Analyses of the nutrient composition of Artemia and copepods show that Atlantic halibut larvae fed Artemia probably receive sufficient amounts of vitamin A by converting canthaxanthin, while iodine may be deficient, possibly leading to interrupted thyroid hormone synthesis. An unbalanced fatty acid composition, such as high levels of arachidonic acid and low levels of docosahexaenoic acid, can be another limiting factor in Artemia. Vitamin A, fatty acids and thyroid hormones have all been shown to affect pigmentation in flatfish. They are ligands to nuclear receptors, thyroid hormone receptors, retinoic acid receptors, retinoic X receptors and peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors, which are members of the superfamily of steroid hormone receptors. The receptors interact with each other to promote gene expression that modulates proliferation and differentiation of cells. Our hypothesis is that these interactions are important for development during flatfish metamorphosis. Very little data exist on the topic of impaired eye migration. However, energy limitation, iodine deficiency and an unbalanced fatty acid composition have been proposed as possible explanations. Here, we review the literature on development of pigment cells and the possible mechanisms behind the effects of vitamin A, fatty acids and thyroid hormone on pigmentation and eye migration during development of Atlantic halibut larvae. {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Six groups of Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus L., larvae were offered calanoid copepods at different periods from days 11 to 25 after first feeding (1.13-3.20mm myotome height) in order to establish at which stage normal pigmentation was determined. Artemia nauplii enriched with an oil emulsion were used prior to and after the copepod period. Control groups were fed on copepods or Artemia only. The Artemia diet initiated an earlier intake of food and higher initial growth compared to the copepod diet. After 50 days of feeding, the average dry weights of the fish fed on Artemia and copepods were quite similar to the copepod-fed fish, while the Artemia-fed fish were the smallest in size. The lowest frequency of normally pigmented juveniles was found in the Artemia-fed group (66.4%), while the copepod group showed almost 100% normal pigmentation. A significantly higher frequency of pigmentation was found in juveniles given a copepod diet close to the initiation of metamorphosis than those provided with an earlier copepod period of equal duration. A high degree of eye migration was found in all groups, but was lowest in the Artemia-fed group. The initial stage of eye migration was found to occur at a larger body size in fish given Artemia and copepods, or a copepod diet than in fish fed on Artemia alone. There was no significant correlation between eye migration and growth rates prior to metamorphosis, although the largest individuals exhibited the most complete eye migration. High pigmentation frequencies were obtained in fish with a low 22:6n-3:20:5n-3 (DHA:EPA) ratio (< 1.0).},

abstract = {Aquaculture is the fastest growing food production industry, and the vast majority of aquaculture products are derived from Asia. The quantity of aquaculture products directly consumed is now greater than that resulting from conventional fisheries. The nutritional value of aquatic products compares favourably with meat from farm animals because they are rich in micronutrients and contain high levels of healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Compared with farm animals, fish are more efficient converters of energy and protein. If the aquaculture sector continues to expand at its current rate, production will reach 132. million tonnes of fish and shellfish and 43. million tonnes of seaweed in 2020. Future potential for marine aquaculture production can be estimated based on the length of coastline, and for freshwater aquaculture from available land area in different countries. The average marine production in 2005 was 103. tonnes per km coastline, varying from 0 to 1721 (China). Freshwater aquaculture production in 2005 averaged 0.17. tonnes/ha, varying from 0 to close to 6. tonnes per ha (Bangladesh), also indicating potential to dramatically increase freshwater aquaculture output. Simple estimations indicate potential for a 20-fold increase in world aquaculture production. Limits imposed by the availability of feed resources would be lessened by growing more herbivorous species and by using more of genetically improved stocks.Aquaculture generally trails far behind plant and farm animal industries in utilizing selective breeding as a tool to improve the biological efficiency of production. It is estimated that at present less than 10% of aquaculture production is based on genetically improved stocks, despite the fact that annual genetic gains reported for aquatic species are substantially higher than that of farm animals. With an average genetic gain in growth rate of 12.5% per generation, production may be dramatically increased if genetically improved animals are used. Importantly, animals selected for faster growth have also been shown to have improved feed conversion and higher survival, implying that increased use of selectively bred stocks leads to better utilization of limited resources such as feed, labour, water, and available land and sea areas. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Healthy human skin harbours a diverse array of microbes that comprise the skin microbiome. Commensal bacteria constitute an important component of resident microbiome and are intricately linked to skin health. Recent studies describe an association between altered skin microbial community and epidemiology of diseases, like psoriasis, atopic dermatitis etc. In this study, we compare the differences in bacterial community of lesional and non-lesional skin of vitiligo subjects. Our study reveals dysbiosis in the diversity of microbial community structure in lesional skin of vitiligo subjects. Although individual specific signature is dominant over the vitiligo-specific microbiota, a clear decrease in taxonomic richness and evenness can be noted in lesional patches. Investigation of community specific correlation networks reveals distinctive pattern of interactions between resident bacterial populations of the two sites (lesional and non-lesional). While Actinobacterial species constitute the central regulatory nodes (w.r.t. degree of interaction) in non-lesional skin, species belonging to Firmicutes dominate on lesional sites. We propose that the changes in taxonomic characteristics of vitiligo lesions, as revealed by our study, could play a crucial role in altering the maintenance and severity of disease. Future studies would elucidate mechanistic relevance of these microbial dynamics that can provide new avenues for therapeutic interventions.},

However, host genomic mechanisms mediating microbial control of intestinal gene expression are poorly understood. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4) is the most ancient family of nuclear receptor transcription factors with important roles in human metabolic and inflammatory bowel diseases, but a role in host response to microbes is unknown. Using an unbiased screening strategy, we found that zebrafish Hnf4a specifically binds and activates a microbiota-suppressed intestinal epithelial transcriptional enhancer. Genetic analysis revealed that zebrafish hnf4a activates nearly half of the genes that are suppressed by microbiota, suggesting microbiota negatively regulate Hnf4a. In support, analysis of genomic architecture in mouse intestinal epithelial cells disclosed that microbiota colonization leads to activation or inactivation of hundreds of enhancers along with drastic genome-wide reduction of HNF4A and HNF4G occupancy. Interspecies meta-analysis suggested interactions between HNF4A and microbiota promote gene expression patterns associated with human inflammatory bowel diseases. These results indicate a critical and conserved role for HNF4A in maintaining intestinal homeostasis in response to microbiota.},

abstract = {High dietary levels of arachidonic acid (ARA) and its relative proportions with eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), fed during early larval stages, have been associated with malpigmentation in various flatfish species. This study investigated whether the nutritional induction of pigmentary disorders at larval stages was related to a specific larval period of increased sensitivity to ARA in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis Kaup, 1858). Senegalese sole larvae were fed high dietary ARA levels during pre- and pro-metamorphosis (2-15dph) and/or post-metamorphosis (15-50dph). Larval tissues reflected the dietary fatty acid composition. Malpigmentations were significantly related to elevated dietary and larval ARA contents and ARA/EPA ratio. This study reports evidence for a "pigmentation window", with a higher larval sensitivity to dietary ARA during pre- and pro-metamorphosis than post-metamorphosis. High dietary ARA fed to larvae during pre-metamorphosis enhanced survival, but did not affect growth nor eye migration. The aspect and density of melanophores in the skin of the ocular side of ARA-induced pseudo-albinos were significantly reduced in comparison to normally pigmented individuals, even more in the pseudo-albino fish fed high dietary ARA levels during the pre-metamorphic stage. Pseudo-albino fish fed high dietary ARA levels during post-metamorphosis showed higher concentrations of 2- and 3-series prostaglandins (PGE2 and PGE3) than normally pigmented specimens fed the same diets. An increased sensitivity to ARA-induced malpigmentations has been identified at pre-metamorphosis and early metamorphosis in Senegalese sole. Supplying high dietary ARA amounts imbalanced the dietary ARA/EPA ratio and disrupted the relative concentrations of derived PGE2 and PGE3, resulting in 20 to 81.7% pseudo-albino individuals, depending on the dietary treatment. The administration of high levels of dietary ARA at different developmental stages did not only affect the incidence of animals with pigmentary disorders, but it also affect the melanophore density and skin aspect in normally pigmented and pseudoalbino fish as image segmentation and texture analyses indicated. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Fish coloration, evolved from selection and adaptation, is a prominent feature of remarkable aquaculture merits. Fish possess more pigment cell types than any other vertebrates and are an excellent model for the study of mechanisms underlying skin coloration and pigmentation at levels from molecular genetics to system biology. How to effectively improve skin colour in ornamental and aquaculture fish has long been a focus on selective breeding programmes. In this review article, we introduce different types of chromatophore and early development of pigmentation, describe cellular mechanisms related to morphological and physiological changes of body colour and demonstrate applications of single-sex control and molecular marker–assisted breeding in body colour selection. We also reviewed genes that have been found involving in neural crest migration and development, as well as those involved in melanin-based coloration and other types of pigmentation, and explored how to use transgenic technology for enhancing fish body colour. The applications of genome editing and other omics technologies in relation to fish coloration are also illustrated. Finally, we present our perspectives about future fish coloration research and practice in aquaculture. Taken together, this review is expected to provide an update on cellular and molecular mechanisms in fish coloration and pigmentation, which will likely promote body colour–based molecular breeding programmes in aquaculture.},

abstract = {Fish aquaculture is considered to be one of the most sustainable sources of protein for humans. Many different species are cultured worldwide, but among them, marine flatfishes comprise a group of teleosts of high commercial interest because of their highly prized white flesh. However, the aquaculture of these fishes is seriously hampered by the scarce knowledge on their biology. In recent years, various experimental 'omics' approaches have been applied to farmed flatfishes to increment the genomic resources available. These tools are beginning to identify genetic markers associated with traits of commercial interest, and to unravel the molecular basis of different physiological processes. This article summarizes recent advances in flatfish genomics research in Europe. We focus on the new generation sequencing technologies, which can produce a massive amount of DNA sequencing data, and discuss their potentials and applications for de novo genome sequencing and transcriptome analysis. The relevance of these methods in nutrigenomics and foodomics approaches for the production of healthy animals, as well as high quality and safety products for the consumer, is also briefly discussed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Flatfish is an important group worldwide aquaculture species, and hypermelanosis on blind side is one of the prevalent and economically important problem which drops market price significantly. Knowledge of whether genetic variation exists for hypermelanosis is needed in order to determine the feasibility of including this trait into the breeding goal. Therefore, the objective of this study was to detect the magnitude of the heritable variation and estimate the heritability for blind-side hypermelanosis by using Chinese tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis). Pigmentation on blind side was defined as three types and fitted in three models respectively, i.e., (i) continuous trait (proportion of non-pigmented area to total area of the blind side) fitted in a linear model (LM); (ii) binary trait (the melanistic scored 1 and the pure white scored 0 by eyes) fitted in cross-sectional threshold model (CTM); (iii) ordinal trait (four categories based on the extent of pigmentation) fitted in ordinal threshold model (OTM). The estimated heritability on observed scale was 0.34 (LM), and on underlying scale was 0.34 and 0.38 for CTM and OTM respectively. All the heritability estimates are associated with large standard errors (SEs) and not significantly different from zero. Anyway, these results point to the existence of genetic variation of blind-side hypermelanosis and the potential for future selective breeding. The greater than zero heritability estimates imply that the selection response is expected by selective breeding in flatfish. Further studies using bigger population data (large family numbers and sample size) are highly recommended.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies have emphasized the importance of the host microbiome in influencing organismal health and development. Aligned with this understanding, our study aimed to investigate the potential association between the turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) phenotypic traits and the post-larval bacteriome. Turbot post-larvae were sampled from twenty randomly selected production cycles thirty days after hatching (DAH) across multiple post-larval production batches over a three-month period (April to June). Fish were selectively sampled based on five phenotypic traits, namely, normal, large, small, malformed, and depigmented. Our results showed that small-sized post-larvae had significantly higher bacterial phylogenetic diversity in their bacterial communities than all other phenotypes. A more in-depth compositional analysis also revealed specific associations between certain bacterial taxa and fish phenotypes. For example, the genera Aliivibrio and Sulfitobacter were enriched in small-sized post-larvae, while the family Micrococcaceae were predominantly found in larger post-larvae. Furthermore, genus Exiguobacterium was linked to depigmented larvae, and genus Pantoea was more prevalent in normal post-larvae. These observations underscore the importance of further research to understand the roles of these bacterial taxa in larval growth and phenotypic differentiation. Such insights could contribute to developing microbiome modulation strategies, which may enhance turbot post-larval health and quality and improve larviculture production.},

abstract = {Golden-colored mutants of turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) have recently been identified in aquaculture, presenting a unique opportunity to study the underlying mechanisms of this rare coloration. This study investigated the differences in skin pigment cells and carotenoid metabolism between golden and normally pigmented turbot. Microscopic and histological analyses revealed that the skin of the control group contained both melanophores and xanthophores, with melanophores exhibiting fully extended dendrites and larger cell volumes, while xanthophores were smaller and dispersed among the melanophores. In contrast, the skin of the golden mutants also contained both melanophores and xanthophores; however, the melanophores were mostly rounded with less extended dendrites and reduced cell volumes, alongside an increase in both the number and size of xanthophores. Additionally, qPCR analysis of the BCL-2 and caspase gene families found no significant differences in the expression levels of selected genes in the skin tissues of turbot with different body colors, suggesting that the color changes in golden mutants are not due to apoptosis of pigment cells. Liquid Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (LC-MS/MS) analysis of carotenoid content showed an upregulation of specific carotenoids in the golden mutants, such as $\epsilon$-carotene and zeaxanthin derivatives. These findings indicate that the golden coloration in turbot is primarily driven by changes in pigment cell composition and carotenoid accumulation. This study provides foundational insights into the genetic and metabolic pathways involved in fish coloration, with significant implications for selective breeding programs in aquaculture.},

abstract = {Trachinotus ovatus is one of the most commercial species in marine aquaculture, making it crucial to investigate the molecular basis underlying its growth-related traits, such as total length (TL). This study had two main objectives: first, to evaluate the influence of genotype imputation on the detection power of genome-wide association studies (GWAS); and second, to screen potential candidate genes affecting growth-related traits in T. ovatus. In this study, a high-quality haplotype reference panel was developed using high coverage resequencing data from 199 individuals representing different populations. The genomic variant dataset was obtained by imputing the low coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) data of 716 individuals using Beagle, with the reference panel. The average imputation accuracy was 0.80, which was influenced by the minor allele frequency (MAF). GWAS was then performed to detect single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genes potentially associated with TL, using both the imputed and lcWGS datasets. The lcWGS and imputation-based GWAS identified 53 and 170 SNPs, annotating 58 and 111 candidate genes, respectively. Of which, 32 genes were shared between both approaches, including genes such as prex1 and ralgps2, which are related to TL. Additionally, several new genes, including mybph, atp5f1d, and ankrd24, were uniquely identified in the imputation-based GWAS. These results demonstrate a clear advantage combining genotype imputation with GWAS for lcWGS data. The approach provides an economically efficient method for expanding the available genotypic information in genomic evaluations, and also provided potential markers for selective breeding in T. ovatus.},

abstract = {Half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis) is a commercially important fish species. There were no reports about accurate genetic parameters of growth traits in C. semilaevis, despite efforts aimed at the culture of this species. Therefore, the main goal of this study was to estimate the parameters for the early growth traits (total length, body depth and body weight) of C. semilaevis based on the data obtained from 80 families. The trait of fish with pure white bottom or not (named as the trait of bottom color) was also analyzed. All the heritabilities estimated for the traits were medium, which varied from 0.210 to 0.362. Genetic correlations among growth traits were highly positive, varying from 0.913 to 0.959, indicating that selection of one of the three traits would result in correlated increase in the others. Also, genetic correlations between bottom color and growth traits were positive and varying from 0.241 to 0.353, suggesting that selection for the bottom color can be utilized to enhance the selection of growth traits. In addition, fish from the top performing 16 full-sib families were selected as broodstock, based on the above analysis and the comparison of family breeding value. This research provides an important basic material to implement selective breeding in C. semilaevis.},

abstract = {The large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) is a commercially important marine fish indigenous to the southeastern coast of China. Cultured L. crocea is frequently subjected to hypoxia which causes huge economic losses to the aquaculture industry. Therefore, it is crucial to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in L. crocea. Here, we combined a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and transcriptome analysis to reveal single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the mechanisms by which they regulate hypoxia tolerance in L. crocea. We used liquid chips to genotype 400 L. crocea individuals, obtained 120,815 high-quality SNPs, identified seven SNPs with significant suggestive association levels, and found a significant peak on chromosome 1. We then combined the potential candidate genes obtained from GWAS with the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) obtained by transcriptome sequencing. We found that the genes and processes related to glucose transport and metabolism, erythropoiesis, ion regulation, DNA replication and repair, and cell cycle were critical to hypoxia adaptation in L. crocea. We also identified the gene lias that might regulate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1$\alpha$. The results of the present study provided insight into the molecular mechanisms of hypoxia tolerance in fish and may facilitate the genetic selection and breeding of hypoxia tolerance in L. crocea.},

abstract = {As a core molecular breeding tool, whole genome sequencing (WGS) can improve the speed of selection and breeding of superior variety and promote the progress of biotechnology-based breeding. However, the high cost of WGS limits its wide application for most aquaculture species. Low-coverage whole genome sequencing is a cost-effective alternative to genotype imputation to obtain a high density of genome-wide SNPs and ultimately Genomic selection (GS) and Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS). In this study, we constructed the first haplotype reference panel for turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), which is an economically important marine farmed fish in China. We performed WGS of fish from major turbot aquaculture areas. We used 183 fish from which six populations as the reference group and 30 individual turbots from a seventh population as the validation group. In total, more than 239 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the reference group, and 4092,338 of them were screened for the construction of the haplotype reference panel. The reference panels were evaluated based on several factors that affect the accuracy of reference panel imputation. Twenty-two chromosomes had imputation accuracies ranging from 0.96 to 0.99, and there were no significant differences among them (p > 0.05). As the sequencing depth increased, the imputation accuracy increased and stabilized at 0.1 ×, ultimately reaching a imputation accuracy of 0.96. As the minor allele frequency (MAF) or genotype probability (GP) increased, the imputation accuracy increased accordingly and eventually stabilized. The results indicated that the depth of coverage could range from 0.1 × to 1.0 × and that the imputation accuracies were all as high as 0.96, which would result in high-quality sequencing data. In conclusion, we constructed a reference panel of turbot haplotypes and determined its depth of coverage for low-coverage whole genome sequencing. This is a cost-effective alternative to whole genome sequencing to provide new ideas for fish breeding.},
