        "\n",
        "Pigmentation disorders represent one of the major biological and economic constraints in flatfish aquaculture. In turbot (*Scophthalmus maximus*), these abnormalities mainly manifest as pseudo-albinism on the ocular side and hypermelanosis on the blind side, leading to a substantial reduction in market value and production efficiency. Such defects originate during early development, particularly around metamorphosis, when asymmetric body patterning and pigmentation are established, and are thought to result from complex interactions between genetic background and environmental factors such as nutrition, light regime, and rearing conditions [@Matsumoto1990; @Hamre2013; @Yufera2018].\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying pigmentation disorders in flatfish remain only partially understood. Previous studies have implicated key biological processes including melanocyte differentiation, neural crest cell migration, retinoid and thyroid hormone signaling, and calcium homeostasis as central drivers of pigment cell development and maintenance [@Seikai1994; @Taguchi2008; @Yao2022]. However, much of the available evidence is based on candidate-gene approaches or interspecific comparisons, and comprehensive transcriptome-wide analyses in turbot are still limited.\n",
        "\n",
        "High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a powerful, unbiased approach to investigate complex phenotypes by enabling genome-wide quantification of gene expression. In pigmentation research, transcriptomic studies have successfully identified differentially expressed genes and regulatory pathways associated with melanogenesis, chromatophore development, and pigment cell survival in several flatfish and teleost species [@Liu2016; @Li2021]. These approaches are particularly well suited to disentangle the polygenic architecture of pigmentation disorders, which are unlikely to be explained by single major-effect loci alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "Within the HOLOFISHCOLOUR project, transcriptomic characterization constitutes a key component for linking genomic variation to functional biological mechanisms. By comparing gene expression profiles between normally pigmented and malpigmented turbot across biologically relevant tissues, this task aims to identify molecular signatures associated with pigmentation anomalies and to complement ongoing genomic, histological, and microbiome analyses. Together, these integrative results will contribute to a holistic, multi-omics understanding of pigmentation disorders in turbot aquaculture.\n",
