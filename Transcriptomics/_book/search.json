    "text": "3 Objectives\nPigmentation disorders represent one of the major biological and economic constraints in flatfish aquaculture. In turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), these abnormalities mainly manifest as pseudo-albinism on the ocular side and hypermelanosis on the blind side, leading to a substantial reduction in market value and production efficiency. Such defects originate during early development, particularly around metamorphosis, when asymmetric body patterning and pigmentation are established, and are thought to result from complex interactions between genetic background and environmental factors such as nutrition, light regime, and rearing conditions (Matsumoto1990?; Hamre2013?; Yúfera 2018).\nDespite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying pigmentation disorders in flatfish remain only partially understood. Previous studies have implicated key biological processes including melanocyte differentiation, neural crest cell migration, retinoid and thyroid hormone signaling, and calcium homeostasis as central drivers of pigment cell development and maintenance (Seikai and Matsumoto 1994; Taguchi2008?; Yao et al. 2022). However, much of the available evidence is based on candidate-gene approaches or interspecific comparisons, and comprehensive transcriptome-wide analyses in turbot are still limited.\nHigh-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a powerful, unbiased approach to investigate complex phenotypes by enabling genome-wide quantification of gene expression. In pigmentation research, transcriptomic studies have successfully identified differentially expressed genes and regulatory pathways associated with melanogenesis, chromatophore development, and pigment cell survival in several flatfish and teleost species (Liu et al. 2016; Li et al. 2021). These approaches are particularly well suited to disentangle the polygenic architecture of pigmentation disorders, which are unlikely to be explained by single major-effect loci alone.\nWithin the HOLOFISHCOLOUR project, transcriptomic characterization constitutes a key component for linking genomic variation to functional biological mechanisms. By comparing gene expression profiles between normally pigmented and malpigmented turbot across biologically relevant tissues, this task aims to identify molecular signatures associated with pigmentation anomalies and to complement ongoing genomic, histological, and microbiome analyses. Together, these integrative results will contribute to a holistic, multi-omics understanding of pigmentation disorders in turbot aquaculture.\nEl objetivo principal de esta tarea fue realizar un perfil transcriptómico global de la piel de rodaballos (Scophthalmus maximus) tanto con fenotipo pigmentario normal como malpigmentado, con el objetivbo de:",

RIN values are computed from automated electrophoretic analyses performed on platforms such as the Agilent Bioanalyzer.\nThe RIN algorithm evaluates multiple features of the electropherogram, including:\n\nThe presence, height, and sharpness of ribosomal RNA peaks (primarily 18S and 28S rRNA in eukaryotes). High-quality RNA typically displays well-defined 18S and 28S peaks with an approximate 2:1 intensity ratio.\nBackground signal and degree of fragmentation. Degraded RNA is characterized by reduced or absent ribosomal peaks and increased signal corresponding to low-molecular-weight fragments.\nOverall signal distribution across fragment sizes, reflecting progressive RNA degradation.\n\nIn high-quality samples, electropherograms show sharp and well-resolved rRNA peaks with low background noise. In contrast, degraded samples exhibit flattened or missing rRNA peaks and a pronounced accumulation of short RNA fragments.\n\n\nMost samples exhibited RIN values between 7.0 and 9.8, which are generally considered suitable for RNA-Seq library construction and downstream differential gene expression analyses. RNA concentrations also fell within acceptable ranges for library preparation, although moderate variability among samples was observed.\nTwo samples deviated from the expected quality standards:\n\nIT12 showed a low RIN value (3.8), indicating substantial RNA degradation. This sample was classified as Fail and deemed unsuitable for RNA-Seq.\nIT16 displayed an intermediate RIN value of 6.0, suggesting partial degradation that could compromise sequencing quality and data interpretation.\n\nAdditionally, ITPNK exhibited slight genomic DNA contamination, as indicated in the Novogene QC report. Despite this observation, the sample passed overall QC criteria.\nGiven that the sequencing budget covered 24 RNA-Seq libraries and 26 samples were initially submitted, samples IT12 and IT16 were excluded from sequencing. The remaining samples met the quality requirements for transcriptomic analysis and were retained for RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing.\n\nQC SummaryBioanalyzer Electropherograms\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 4.1: Summary of RNA concentration, integrity (RIN), and QC status for samples assessed prior to RNA-Seq library preparation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo.\nSample\nConcentration (ng/µl)\nVolume (µl)\nTotal amount (µg)\nRIN\nSample QC Results\n\n\n\n\n1\nP31\n1851.34\n16\n29.62141\n7.7\nPass\n\n\n2\nP32\n2022.42\n16\n32.35878\n8.3\nPass\n\n\n3\nP33\n483.84\n13\n6.28990\n8.8\nPass\n\n\n4\nP34\n826.81\n17\n14.05583\n8.8\nPass\n\n\n5\nP35\n430.00\n16\n6.87994\n8.2\nPass\n\n\n6\nP36\n447.89\n16\n7.16622\n7.2\nPass\n\n\n7\nP41\n1270.12\n16\n20.32186\n9.3\nPass\n\n\n8\nP42\n888.98\n19\n16.89067\n8.8\nPass\n\n\n9\nP43\n1343.73\n19\n25.53087\n8.0\nPass\n\n\n10\nP44\n1961.08\n18\n35.29941\n7.8\nPass\n\n\n11\nP45\n709.86\n18\n12.77749\n8.1\nPass\n\n\n12\nP46\n768.56\n18\n13.83416\n8.9\nPass\n\n\n13\nP47\n342.27\n19\n6.50313\n8.5\nPass\n\n\n14\nP48\n404.26\n17\n6.87242\n7.8\nPass\n\n\n15\nP49\n954.50\n16\n15.27201\n8.8\nPass\n\n\n16\nP50\n295.43\n16\n4.72680\n9.6\nPass\n\n\n17\nP51\n2511.00\n13\n32.64302\n9.5\nPass\n\n\n18\nP52\n578.87\n15\n8.68312\n9.8\nPass\n\n\n19\nP1G\n150.06\n16\n2.40097\n8.9\nPass\n\n\n20\nP2G\n192.33\n16\n3.07729\n9.0\nPass\n\n\n21\nPNKD\n417.18\n18\n7.50923\n8.7\nPass\n\n\n22\nPNKV\n221.19\n17\n3.76027\n8.4\nPass\n\n\n23\nIT12\n2422.80\n17\n41.18753\n3.8\nFail\n\n\n24\nIT16\n2988.15\n18\n53.78664\n6.0\nPass\n\n\n25\nIT1G\n2842.68\n16\n45.48292\n7.8\nPass\n\n\n26\nITPNK\n4493.36\n18\n80.88050\n7.1\nPass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT12IT16IT1GITPNKPNKDPNKVP1GP2GP31P32P33P34P35P36P41P42P43P44P45P46P47P48P49P50P51P52\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure: RNA quality control electropherograms generated using the Agilent 5400 Bioanalyzer.

What is the influence of RNA concentration on library construction?\nRNA concentration determines the total RNA input available for library preparation. Insufficient RNA input may result in low library yield or library construction failure. Additional RNA concentration steps may increase degradation risk.\nQ2. Does genomic DNA contamination affect poly(A)-enriched mRNA library preparation?\nGenomic DNA is not retained during poly(A) enrichment–based mRNA library preparation. Therefore, low-level genomic DNA contamination does not affect downstream library construction when samples pass QC.\nQ3. What RNA purification methods are used and how much RNA loss is expected?\nRNA purification is typically performed using column-based or magnetic bead–based methods. RNA loss after purification is expected to be approximately 60%, depending on the purification strategy and initial RNA quality.",
