# Introduction

Pigmentation disorders represent one of the major biological and economic constraints in flatfish aquaculture. In turbot (*Scophthalmus maximus*), these abnormalities mainly manifest as pseudo-albinism on the ocular side and hypermelanosis on the blind side, leading to a substantial reduction in market value and production efficiency. Such defects originate during early development, particularly around metamorphosis, when asymmetric body patterning and pigmentation are established, and are thought to result from complex interactions between genetic background and environmental factors such as nutrition, light regime, and rearing conditions [@Matsumoto1990; @Hamre2013; @Yufera2018].

Despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms underlying pigmentation disorders in flatfish remain only partially understood. Previous studies have implicated key biological processes including melanocyte differentiation, neural crest cell migration, retinoid and thyroid hormone signaling, and calcium homeostasis as central drivers of pigment cell development and maintenance [@Seikai1994; @Taguchi2008; @Yao2022]. However, much of the available evidence is based on candidate-gene approaches or interspecific comparisons, and comprehensive transcriptome-wide analyses in turbot are still limited.

High-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides a powerful, unbiased approach to investigate complex phenotypes by enabling genome-wide quantification of gene expression. In pigmentation research, transcriptomic studies have successfully identified differentially expressed genes and regulatory pathways associated with melanogenesis, chromatophore development, and pigment cell survival in several flatfish and teleost species [@Liu2016; @Li2021]. These approaches are particularly well suited to disentangle the polygenic architecture of pigmentation disorders, which are unlikely to be explained by single major-effect loci alone.

Within the HOLOFISHCOLOUR project, transcriptomic characterization constitutes a key component for linking genomic variation to functional biological mechanisms. By comparing gene expression profiles between normally pigmented and malpigmented turbot across biologically relevant tissues, this task aims to identify molecular signatures associated with pigmentation anomalies and to complement ongoing genomic, histological, and microbiome analyses. Together, these integrative results will contribute to a holistic, multi-omics understanding of pigmentation disorders in turbot aquaculture.

# Materials and Methods

## Experimental design and Sampling

## Fishes

Three individuals per phenotype (normal vs malpigmented) were selected from tanks **E6** and **E8**, where pigmentation differences were most pronounced.

-   **Tank E6:** offspring from two different parental pairs.\
-   **Tank E8:** half-sib family (shared mother, two different fathers).

From each individual, **skin and intestine** samples were collected.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sample Types and Pigmentation Categories

-   **Normally pigmented fish:**
    -   Pigmented skin (dark) on the ocular side
    -   Non-pigmented skin (light) on the blind side
-   **Malpigmented fish:**
    -   Pigmented and non-pigmented skin on both ocular and blind sides

## Sample Collection

### Skin Sampling

Fish were maintained at −80 °C and placed on ice prior to sampling to prevent rapid thawing. While still frozen, approximately **20 mg of skin tissue** were excised using sterile dissection tools.

Muscle tissue was carefully removed by gentle scraping to avoid contamination.

![**Figure 1.** Skin sampling for transcriptomic analysis. A–B: Sampling areas in pseudo-albino and normally pigmented turbot. Areas outlined with yellow dashed lines correspond to non-pigmented skin, whereas areas outlined in red correspond to pigmented skin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3.2 Intestinal Sampling

Intestinal samples were obtained by ventral dissection. The visceral mass was removed, and intestinal contents were gently expelled before collecting the posterior intestine segment.

## RNA-Seq Library Preparation and Sequencing

Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) was performed through the *Plant and Animal Whole Genome Sequencing (WOBI)* service (@tbl-rnaseq-specs), outsourced to Novogene (quotation **NVUK2024021911**). Messenger RNA (mRNA) libraries were constructed using a strand-specific protocol, preserving transcript orientation information and enabling accurate downstream expression analyses.

Library preparation was based on poly(A) enrichment to selectively capture mature mRNA transcripts. Sequencing was carried out on an Illumina NovaSeq X Plus platform using a paired-end strategy with a read length of 150 base pairs (2 × 150 bp, PE150).

Sequencing quality criteria were defined to ensure high data reliability, with at least 85% of bases achieving a Phred quality score ≥ Q30. A minimum sequencing output of 6 Gb per sample was guaranteed, providing sufficient depth and coverage for subsequent differential gene expression analyses. In total, 50 RNA-Seq libraries were successfully sequenced.

## RNA Quality Control

RNA quality assessment was performed as a mandatory quality control step prior to RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing. RNA concentration, integrity, and purity metrics were evaluated by Novogene using the **Agilent 5400 Bioanalyzer**, following standard procedures for transcriptomic applications.

The complete quality control results for all submitted samples are summarized in @tbl-rnaseq-qc, including RNA concentration, total RNA amount, RNA Integrity Number (RIN), and final QC status. Representative electropherograms generated during the analysis are shown in @fig-rin-electropherograms.

::: callout-note
## RNA Integrity Number (RIN): technical background

![Representative RNA electropherograms illustrating different levels of RNA integrity (RIN = 10, 5, and 3).](figures/RIN_explanation.png){#fig-rin-electropherograms width="85%"}

The **RNA Integrity Number (RIN)** is a numerical score ranging from **1 (fully degraded RNA)** to **10 (intact RNA)**, widely used to assess total RNA quality. RIN values are computed from automated electrophoretic analyses performed on platforms such as the Agilent Bioanalyzer.

The RIN algorithm evaluates multiple features of the electropherogram, including:

-   The presence, height, and sharpness of ribosomal RNA peaks (primarily **18S and 28S rRNA** in eukaryotes). High-quality RNA typically displays well-defined 18S and 28S peaks with an approximate **2:1 intensity ratio**.
-   Background signal and degree of fragmentation. Degraded RNA is characterized by reduced or absent ribosomal peaks and increased signal corresponding to low-molecular-weight fragments.
-   Overall signal distribution across fragment sizes, reflecting progressive RNA degradation.

In high-quality samples, electropherograms show sharp and well-resolved rRNA peaks with low background noise. In contrast, degraded samples exhibit flattened or missing rRNA peaks and a pronounced accumulation of short RNA fragments.
:::

Most samples exhibited **RIN values between 7.0 and 9.8**, which are generally considered suitable for RNA-Seq library construction and downstream differential gene expression analyses. RNA concentrations also fell within acceptable ranges for library preparation, although moderate variability among samples was observed.

Two samples deviated from the expected quality standards:

-   **IT12** showed a **low RIN value (3.8)**, indicating substantial RNA degradation. This sample was classified as *Fail* and deemed unsuitable for RNA-Seq.
-   **IT16** displayed an intermediate **RIN value of 6.0**, suggesting partial degradation that could compromise sequencing quality and data interpretation.

Additionally, **ITPNK** exhibited slight genomic DNA contamination, as indicated in the Novogene QC report. Despite this observation, the sample passed overall QC criteria.

Given that the sequencing budget covered **24 RNA-Seq libraries** and **26 samples** were initially submitted, **samples IT12 and IT16 were excluded from sequencing**. The remaining samples met the quality requirements for transcriptomic analysis and were retained for RNA-Seq library preparation and sequencing.

## Technical notes from the Novogene RNA QC report

**Q1. What is the influence of RNA concentration on library construction?**\
RNA concentration determines the total RNA input available for library preparation. Insufficient RNA input may result in low library yield or library construction failure. Additional RNA concentration steps may increase degradation risk.

**Q2. Does genomic DNA contamination affect poly(A)-enriched mRNA library preparation?**\
Genomic DNA is not retained during poly(A) enrichment–based mRNA library preparation. Therefore, low-level genomic DNA contamination does not affect downstream library construction when samples pass QC.

**Q3. What RNA purification methods are used and how much RNA loss is expected?**\
RNA purification is typically performed using column-based or magnetic bead–based methods. RNA loss after purification is expected to be approximately **60%**, depending on the purification strategy and initial RNA quality.

## Bioinformatic Analysis

### Overview

The bioinformatic workflow included:

1.  Raw read quality control
2.  Alignment to the reference genome
3.  Gene-level quantification
4.  Differential expression analysis
5.  Functional enrichment analysis

![RNA-seq bioinformatic workflow](figures/Flowchart_RNAseq_pipeline.png)

## Reference Genome

RNA-seq analyses were conducted using the **Scophthalmus maximus ASM1334776v1** reference genome assembly and its corresponding gene annotation, both obtained from **Ensembl (release 113)**. This assembly provides comprehensive coverage of the turbot genome, including both assembled chromosomes and unplaced contigs and scaffolds.

The reference genome and annotation files are publicly available from Ensembl:\
<https://www.ensembl.org/Scophthalmus_maximus/Info/Index>

### Genome and annotation files used

For read alignment and transcript quantification, we used the **toplevel genome FASTA file** (`Scophthalmus_maximus.ASM1334776v1.dna.toplevel.fa`) and the **full Ensembl gene annotation in GTF format** (`Scophthalmus_maximus.ASM1334776v1.113.gtf`). These files were downloaded from the Ensembl FTP server (release 113):

-   Genome FASTA: <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-113/fasta/scophthalmus_maximus/dna/>

-   Gene annotation (GTF): <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-113/gtf/scophthalmus_maximus/>

This combination ensures that RNA-seq reads mapping to both chromosomal and non-chromosomal regions are retained, preventing the loss of annotated genes located in unassembled genomic regions. The **GTF format** was selected due to its broad compatibility with RNA-seq analysis tools such as **STAR**, **HTSeq**, and **featureCounts**, and its suitability for transcript-level quantification.

::: {.callout-important title="Genome and annotation file types (Ensembl technical note)"}
Ensembl provides multiple genome sequence and annotation file types, each optimized for different applications. The main file types relevant for RNA-seq analyses are summarized below.

**Genome FASTA files**

-   **`*.dna.toplevel.fa`** ✅ *(used in this study)*\
    Includes all assembled chromosomes as well as unplaced contigs and scaffolds. This is the most comprehensive genome representation and ensures that RNA-seq reads mapping to non-chromosomal regions are not lost.

-   **`*.dna.primary_assembly.fa`**\
    Contains only primary assembled chromosomes and selected scaffolds, excluding smaller unplaced contigs.

-   **`*.dna.chromosome.*.fa`**\
    Individual FASTA files for each chromosome, mainly useful for region-specific or targeted analyses.

-   **`*.dna.nonchromosomal.fa`**\
    Contains only unplaced contigs and scaffolds and is not suitable for whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analyses.

-   **`*.dna_sm.toplevel.fa`**\
    Equivalent to the toplevel FASTA file but soft-masked (repetitive regions in lowercase). This is not required for standard RNA-seq workflows.

**Gene annotation files**

-   **GTF (`*.gtf`)** ✅ *(used in this study)*\
    Compact gene annotation format optimized for RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Fully compatible with tools such as **STAR**, **HTSeq**, and **featureCounts**.

-   **GFF3 (`*.gff3`)**\
    A more general-purpose annotation format that includes additional genomic features but often requires conversion for RNA-seq applications.

-   **Ab initio GTF (`*.abinitio.gtf`)**\
    Contains gene predictions generated without experimental evidence and was not used due to lower reliability.

Overall, the combination of the **toplevel genome assembly** and the **full Ensembl GTF annotation** provides a robust and comprehensive reference framework for RNA-seq analyses, minimizing mapping bias and ensuring accurate gene expression quantification across the entire turbot genome.
