# RNA-seq data processing and quality assessment

## Overview of sequencing data

Brief overview of the RNA-seq dataset processed in this report:

- **Samples:** *[N]* libraries (paired-end)
- **Library type:** stranded mRNA-seq
- **Read configuration:** 2 × 150 bp (PE150)
- **Target yield:** ~6 Gb per sample (Novogene service specifications)

> Replace *[N]* with the final number of sequenced libraries included in nf-core/rnaseq.

## Quality control summary (MultiQC)

The complete MultiQC report generated by the nf-core/rnaseq pipeline is embedded below. This report aggregates QC metrics across all samples, including sequencing quality (FastQC), trimming summaries (Trim Galore), alignment statistics (STAR), and quantification metrics (Salmon).

## Read trimming and filtering

Summarise the main trimming outcomes reported in MultiQC:

- Adapter sequences: *[removed / not detected]*  
- Reads retained after trimming: *[~X%]*  
- Any notable sample outliers: *[yes/no]*

> Keep this section short unless you had real issues (e.g., heavy adapter contamination or strong sample-to-sample variability).

## Alignment to the reference genome (STAR)

Key mapping metrics from STAR (as reported in MultiQC):

- Uniquely mapped reads: *[median X%, range Y–Z%]*  
- Multi-mapped reads: *[median X%]*  
- Unmapped reads: *[median X%]*  

Overall, alignment rates were *[consistent / variable]* across samples, with *[no / a few]* technical outliers.

---

## Transcript quantification (Salmon)

Quantification metrics reported by Salmon:

- Mapping rate: *[median X%, range Y–Z%]*  
- Number of expressed genes detected: *[approx. X]*  
- Overall, quantification profiles were *[consistent]* and suitable for downstream differential expression analysis.

## Summary of data quality

Overall, the RNA-seq dataset showed *[high]* sequencing quality, *[effective]* trimming, and *[robust]* alignment/quantification performance across samples, supporting its suitability for downstream differential expression and functional analyses.
