## Bioinformatic Analysis

### Overview

The bioinformatic workflow included:

1.  Raw read quality control
2.  Alignment to the reference genome
3.  Gene-level quantification
4.  Differential expression analysis
5.  Functional enrichment analysis

## Reference Genome

RNA-seq analyses were conducted using the **Scophthalmus maximus ASM1334776v1** reference genome assembly and its corresponding gene annotation, both obtained from **Ensembl (release 113)**. This assembly provides comprehensive coverage of the turbot genome, including both assembled chromosomes and unplaced contigs and scaffolds.

The reference genome and annotation files are publicly available from Ensembl:\

### Genome and annotation files used

For read alignment and transcript quantification, we used the **toplevel genome FASTA file** (`Scophthalmus_maximus.ASM1334776v1.dna.toplevel.fa`) and the **full Ensembl gene annotation in GTF format** (`Scophthalmus_maximus.ASM1334776v1.113.gtf`). These files were downloaded from the Ensembl FTP server (release 113):

-   Genome FASTA: <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-113/fasta/scophthalmus_maximus/dna/>

-   Gene annotation (GTF): <https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-113/gtf/scophthalmus_maximus/>

This combination ensures that RNA-seq reads mapping to both chromosomal and non-chromosomal regions are retained, preventing the loss of annotated genes located in unassembled genomic regions. The **GTF format** was selected due to its broad compatibility with RNA-seq analysis tools such as **STAR**, **HTSeq**, and **featureCounts**, and its suitability for transcript-level quantification.

::: {.callout-important title="Genome and annotation file types (Ensembl technical note)"}
Ensembl provides multiple genome sequence and annotation file types, each optimized for different applications. The main file types relevant for RNA-seq analyses are summarized below.

**Genome FASTA files**

-   **`*.dna.toplevel.fa`** ✅ *(used in this study)*\
    Includes all assembled chromosomes as well as unplaced contigs and scaffolds. This is the most comprehensive genome representation and ensures that RNA-seq reads mapping to non-chromosomal regions are not lost.

-   **`*.dna.primary_assembly.fa`**\
    Contains only primary assembled chromosomes and selected scaffolds, excluding smaller unplaced contigs.

-   **`*.dna.chromosome.*.fa`**\
    Individual FASTA files for each chromosome, mainly useful for region-specific or targeted analyses.

-   **`*.dna.nonchromosomal.fa`**\
    Contains only unplaced contigs and scaffolds and is not suitable for whole-transcriptome RNA-seq analyses.

-   **`*.dna_sm.toplevel.fa`**\
    Equivalent to the toplevel FASTA file but soft-masked (repetitive regions in lowercase). This is not required for standard RNA-seq workflows.

**Gene annotation files**

-   **GTF (`*.gtf`)** ✅ *(used in this study)*\
    Compact gene annotation format optimized for RNA-seq analysis pipelines. Fully compatible with tools such as **STAR**, **HTSeq**, and **featureCounts**.

-   **GFF3 (`*.gff3`)**\
    A more general-purpose annotation format that includes additional genomic features but often requires conversion for RNA-seq applications.

-   **Ab initio GTF (`*.abinitio.gtf`)**\
    Contains gene predictions generated without experimental evidence and was not used due to lower reliability.

Overall, the combination of the **toplevel genome assembly** and the **full Ensembl GTF annotation** provides a robust and comprehensive reference framework for RNA-seq analyses, minimizing mapping bias and ensuring accurate gene expression quantification across the entire turbot genome.

## Notes and Next Steps

This transcriptomic dataset provides a solid foundation for:

-   Integrating GWAS candidate genes
-   Cross-validating pigmentation pathways
-   Comparative analyses with other flatfish species
-   Multi-omics integration within the HOLOFISHCOLOUR framework

Further refinement will include: - Differential expression results - GO / KEGG enrichment - Integration with phenotypic pigmentation metrics
