# Overview

This document presents the transcriptomic analysis conducted within the **HOLOFISHCOLOUR** project, aimed at characterising the molecular mechanisms associated with pigmentation disorders in turbot (*Scophthalmus maximus*).  

RNA-seq data were processed using the **nf-core/rnaseq** pipeline, ensuring a reproducible and standardised workflow for quality control, alignment, quantification and downstream analyses.

The report has been structured as a unified, navigable document generated with **Quarto**, integrating results, figures and quality-control summaries into a single HTML output.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this analysis are:

- To assess the quality of RNA-seq data using comprehensive QC metrics.
- To obtain reliable gene-level expression estimates.
- To explore transcriptional differences associated with pigmentation phenotypes.
- To generate publication-ready outputs suitable for downstream statistical and functional analyses.
